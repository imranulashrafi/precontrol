Guns cause nothing but problems. All you need to do is pick one up and pull the trigger to end a life.  The main argument seems to be that guns are for safety and protection. I just read a story about a woman who was in full support of gun ownership and she got shot in the back by her four year old son. So Option A: have guns lying around the house, waiting for an accident to happen. Option B: lock the gun away and defeat the purpose of having it around to protect yourself.  With all these mass shootings in America, with 5 year old kids being involved in massacres, I don't understand how the laws have been changed straight away and why it's so hard for (some) americans to see how truly awful guns are. In other countries with strict gun laws, you still have maniacs who cause mass stabbings with significantly lower rates of casualties.  And the phrase \" guns don't kill people, people kill people\". What even is the message here? OF COURSE guns kill people. They are chunks of metal that with one trigger pull, release a high speed bullet that penetrates the body causing death or serious injury. It is so, so easy to kill someone with a gun as opposed to a knife or baseball bat. It's a sad fact that there are maniacs out there, or people with serious mental health problems, and they should be supported, but what do people expect when it's so damn easy for them to access guns? People can talk about mental health awareness etc all they want, but the fact of the matter is, easy access to guns are a huge factor in why these mass shootings are so easy to pull off.  I was in Florida a couple of years ago and saw a gun shop and the idea of it seemed so bizzarre and unsettling to me, that anyone can just walk in and buy a pistol or whatever. The fact you could be strolling around a shopping mall and some heart broken man or woman can release rounds on a machine gun while you're doing your supermarket. Sure it's really rare, but even the possibility of it happening is so disturbing.  Here in Ireland the gun laws are extremely strict, there are no casual gun shops around, and they're really only used for the army and hunting. It freaks me out that in a lot of states in America, anyone can buy a gun really.  I may sound passionate about my views, but I really am curious to hear the opposing side, the one that supports gun ownership. I don't know any americans personally so I'd love to hear the opposite argument. Why are relaxed gun laws better than strict gun laws? Is it the fact that it's too late to change, too many people own guns and it would cause more problems?

I am a supporter of being able to own a gun, but I don't own a gun because the process to get one in New York is a huge pain in the ass for someone doing it legally. You have to go pay $20 or so to get the application, you have to go to the nearest sheriff office and have them mail a background check to you clearing you to own a gun, then you have to go get your fingerprints taken for $175 on only the second or 4th Wednesday a month from like 12PM-2PM, then you have to get 3 references that they will call and ask about you, and then once you make it through all that, about 9 months is the fastest that I have seen someone actually get their permit.

Also popular was sauerkraut, which prevented scurvy (it's high in vitamin C and does not spoil). Thanks to its popularity at sea, literally every immigrant to America was familiar with the cucumber pickle.   Even Shakespeare was calling them just \"pickles\" by 1611. He coined the phrase \"in a pickle\" as well (in *The Tempest*). This precedent in English was carried to the New World, although pickles were still not terribly common as daily foodstuff, generally just used at sea and in specialty recipes. Authors would call them things like \"a rare delight\" or treat.  In the late 18th century, a frenchman, Nicolas Appert, perfected the process of canning. He fermented vegetables and canned them, creating the first industrial scale autoclave in the process. He won an award from Napoleon's government for perfecting a way to feed troops in distant lands without the food spoiling in transit. He built a cannery in America in 1820. It's no surprise that the best selling product was the venerated cucumber pickle. Now you could easily go any buy pickles any time. Their popularity at home soared.  Further, in 1878, Mason invented his eponymous jar that allowed pickling at home. Pickles made the transition from seagoing and wartime ration to the typical dinner table and then, thanks to Mason, became an integral part of annual food preservation. By the time Heinz started marketing their 57 varieties, putting glass jarred pickles in every home in America as a common snack and sauce ingredient, they were already calling pickles cucumbers \"pickles\" and specifying other pickled items by name, like \"gherkins\" or \"pickled onions\". Studying marketing material from the 18th and 19th century, you just can't find \"pickled cucumber\" being specified; in America the most common pickle was the cucumber variety and was always just called a *pickle* from the get-go.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 17287.0, "score_ratio": 1.125}

The information is useful after a crash, or after a near miss/emergency, but it's not particularly useful any other time.   It's hard to estimate how many planes fly a day, but based on FAA information on faa.gov, just the US FAA handles: 16,100,000 flights a year (including international flights that enter FAA areas). That's 44,000+ daily flights. There are 5000 planes in the sky at any time at peak travel just in the US alone.   In 2019 there were 14 fatal crashes *globally.*   The amount of real-time data streaming you'd need to track even just the domestic commercial flights, plus cargo flights would be staggering. Streaming telemetry and voice from the entirety of a flight's transit would require massive amounts of data, storage and processing. And it's only needed those 14 times a year.   There are limited ways to transmit data from a plane, you've got terrestrial and satellite. Terrestrial wouldn't work, there are too many hops between towers. Satellite would be available, but someone would have to put the satellites up just to record flight data. If you've ever seen how crappy in-flight WiFi is, imagine how bad having to move the data from 16 million flights would be.   You couldn't rely on that transmission either, because it's another system to go down, satellites lose communication etc.   The flight data recorders and cockpit voice recoders are designed to survive 3400Gs and temperatures exceeding 1000\u00ba C (1830\u00ba F).   The NTSB has proposed cockpit image recorders as well, because control panels are now electronic\u2014when a plane crashed with an analog gauge it usually stayed on the last position at impact. LCD screens just break.      (A good overview is here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight\\_recorder)  In 2014 after the Malaysia flight vanished, there were pushes to make planes transmit their data or to eject from planes before crashes.   House Rep David Price called for black boxes that would eject after Malaysia Flight 370 vanished.   \"But he said the 9/11 Commission recommended after the terrorist hijackings in 2001 that planes carry ejectable \"black boxes\" to make them easier to find. Navy planes have carried them for years, and Transportation Security Administration was given $3.5 million in 2008 to study and test the proposal.\"  Which is good except, it's not moving along very well. The same article from that quote points out that F/A 18 Navy jets have black boxes that eject on impact detection, or when the ejection seat is triggered, and they float at well.   In many cases, you don't need a FDR and CVR to figure out what happened, though of course they're always helpful as they show you exactly how the crew and the plane reacted. In the 14 2019 incidents, one was an attempted hijacking . There was no crash, the hijacker was killed, so that's considered a flight-based fatality for some reason. Three were planes that overshot the runways. The reason for those crashes is almost always pilot error.   There was one bird strike (cause of crash, birds), one was a collision between two planes (cause of crash, collision), one plane hit the runway twice, banked, and hit a building. Passengers who evacuated via the wing-exits slipped on ice on the wing. (cause of crash, ice). One had a plane flying through thunderstorms.  In a few of them the cause of the crash was determined via FDR or CVR, and several were crew error.

What my view is:  I'm not taking a stance on what the policy surrounding child support should be, nor am I claiming that \"putting the needs of the child first\" is the only or best reason for keeping the laws the way they are. The specific view that I would like changed is this: \\*\\*When people say \"requiring men to pay child support is about putting the needs of the child first\", by and large, they are being intellectually dishonest\\*\\*. This does not mean I think people are secretly saying \"Of course this isn't true, but I will lie about it\". This does not mean that there don't exist exceptions where people would engage honestly. What it does mean is that the majority of the time someone says \"we have to put the child's needs first\" as a justification for requiring men to pay child support, they will then show signs of intellectual dishonesty if pressed on inconsistencies rather than addressing the arguments with counter arguments that they genuinely find to be convincing.  &#x200B;  Why I hold it:  Every time I have this conversation with someone, this claim is made, and every time when I point out the logical consequences of this belief (e.g. that it would require mandatory adoption in cases where that would provide a better home for the kid) I am met with various sorts of intellectual dishonesty and never an actual argument that addresses or concedes the point.  &#x200B;  Ways to change my view:  1) Show me that I'm wrong about there existing an inconsistency in the first place. While it's possible to argue dishonestly for true things, people can also be terrible at identifying their true reasoning. If they have the benefit of actually being right, I'm more likely to believe that they're doing their best and the signs of intellectual dishonesty are because they don't know how to argue any more coherently.  &#x200B;  2) Show me that there is a line of argumentation that is difficult to articulate and can remain convincing even in the face of the kind of arguments I've been providing, even if it does not ultimately hold up once articulated.  &#x200B;  2) If there is a strong majority response of \"yes, I'm the kind of person who says that it's all about the children and I know it's not 100% true, but this is not dishonest because I am completely willing to clarify this when it comes up\". I say \"strong majority\" because how things are framed changes how people respond (and who will respond), and even if there is a weak majority here it is likely that without this framing the response would be different.  &#x200B;  3) If there is a strong majority response of being willing to engage honestly about the existence of the contradiction, even if such discussion does not change my mind about the existence of the inconsistency or even the existence of arguments which don't immediately fall apart when challenged. Minds changing on the other side would be proof of honesty, but lack of change would not be proof of dishonesty.  &#x200B;  \"It's about putting the needs of the child first\" is such a common refrain that it's sure to come up with almost anyone if you raise the topic, and fraudulent claims of moral high ground as so reprehensible that holding this view requires I have a fairly dim view of humanity.

I have a fairly serious chronic health condition. I\u2019ve been with my job for close to 1.5 years and have managed working full time well, but my symptoms have really flared lately to the point I need medical leave. I also have STD coverage through my employer.   I brought up my need for leave with my supervisor last week and had a phone chat with HR about my options. Both were very supportive and my HR rep advised I would likely qualify for both FMLA and STD. HR provided me with forms and encouraged me to see my PCP asap. I then got a bit of sassiness/rudeness from upper management on my team - but I get it, having people out can be rough.   However, after the weird stuff from upper management I received an email from the same HR rep with completely different and somewhat misleading/false advice-   \u201cUnfortunately based on what you have shared with me yesterday regarding your chronic health condition that you mentioned was diagnosed in 2019, I do not believe that you currently qualify for a short-term disability leave or FMLA leave.

However without a medical document supporting your request for time off  to deal with your health we are unable to move forward\u201d   From what I understand chronic conditions are clearly covered under FMLA? I read a chronic condition is defined as one you\u2019ve sought treatment for at least twice in the last year, which I meet. I also called the insurance company and discovered that chronic conditions are covered by STD after a 12-month waiting period, which I also satisfy.   In any case- I saw my doctor today (as the HR rep originally advised- I was so confused by the email\u2019s end as we had already discussed I would need documentation) and he\u2019s fully supportive to sign off for FMLA and STD. So the point is kinda moot- I\u2019m going to get my leave and hopefully my disability. Im just feeling a little icky about this. I work for a company that loves to tout its great benefits and human-centric culture. This experience honestly makes me feel discouraged from returning to the company after my leave.   So AskHr, what should I do? Of course, I could do nothing- I\u2019m going to get the leave I  need.

To the surprise of exactly nobody, this made some people upset.  There are complains of political correctness or making changes to try and pander to a new audience and people up and down the comments section of that article are saying how they're going to cancel their Thor subscriptions.  I don't really see the problem.  First of all, a close reading of the article implies that it isn't actually Thor himself, but another individual who has taken up the mantle of Thor (not entirely unlike Beta Ray Bill).  Second, even if this new female Thor does become a mainstay of the comics, what's the big deal?  Is a woman Thor incapable of performing the feats of strength that a male Thor is?  I think not.  Would a woman Thor be too emotional?  Not if she's written well.  Yes, it will be \"different,\" but different isn't always bad, and if this new Thor is written by *good* writers who know how to properly structure a plot then I don't see why it matters if Thor is a man or a woman.  One of the most common arguments I see with matters like this (it's quite similar, IMO, to when they cast Idris Elba as Heimdall in the Thor film) is that they should just make an original character instead of re-inventing an old character.  First of all, it does seem like, in this situation, it *is* a new character (or perhaps an old character Marvel recently acquired).  Second of all, while it is possible to create a new character there is no way that character could possibly have the name brand recognition as one of the already-established big three names in Marvel comics.  And when you're trying to reinvent your universe to seem less \"male-oriented\" and therefore be more marketable to women and girls, making it so that at least one of the big three names is female seems like a very rational choice (heck, DC's big three has included a woman for *decades*).

Not that I don't have faith in Jason Aaron (he's already established Thor as one of the best titles Marvel is putting out), or that I disagree with Marvel trying to create more female heros. But let's consider Thor's history.  Why does Mjolner's enchantment state, \"whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall posses the power of Thor\"? It's not because Odin wanted random mortals (however worthy) to stumble upon incredible power. It's because *he wanted his son to become worthy*. The hammer was always meant to be wielded by Thor; if anyone else can pick it up, that's just an unfortunate side-effect of the enchantment. This is obvious in the old Simonson comics: when Beta Ray Bill manages to pick up Thor's hammer, Odin is *astonished*, and admits he never expected it to happen. And at the end of that storyarc, he *makes sure Thor get's back his hammer*.  To summarize: The hammer was never meant to be given to anyone who was worthy. It was meant to remind Thor to always be worthy.  So: In this storyarc, Thor somehow becomes unworthy of wielding Mjolner. Someone else (my bet is on Jane Foster, although Thor's granddaughter is also a possibility) finds the hammer, and becomes the new Thor! And what happens to Thor?  Well, to be true to the history of the character, Thor is going to have to go on some sort of hero's journey in which he eventually becomes worthy again, and can return to claim Mjolner once more. (The last Avengers issue gave us some bullshit glimpse into the future which suggested Thor still won't be worthy 400 years in the future, but that won't happen. Marvel mucks around with its future all the time, and at best what we saw in Avengers was a *possible* future which Thor will manage to avoid) It has to happen that way, because that is the *purpose* of Mjolner's enchantment.  Where will that leave our new Thor? Well, we will perhaps get a year or two of enjoyable stories out of her. After that, the son of Odin will return, the female Thor will be cast aside, and we will all realize that this supposedly progressive female Thor served no purpose except as a foil for the \"true\" male hero. Best case scenario, Odin will forge her another Mjolner (as he did Beta Ray Bill), and she will exist as a minor side character to the Marvel universe.  Perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps she will really be the one true Thor for four hundred years. But Marvel has no problems lying or exaggerating temporary character changes (they said Peter Parker would be dead forever, but that didn't last more than two years). And Superior Spider-Man, the last major hero-replacement, proceeded exactly as I described: two years of enjoyable stories, then the realization that Doctor Octopus is only Spider-Man so that people will cheer when Peter Parker takes his place.  So I guess I don't necessarily think it's *bad* so much as meaningless, because it's not going to last. Everything Marvel has ever done points to this ending inside of two years.

First step is to make a (new) Twitter account of course, lol, with minimal personal stuff of anything you wouldn't want colleagues and advisors to see. Keep all that separate.

Hi, I work for a small start-up company working on some very interesting stuff in the field of air and space. There's about 8 people not including the board and operations/HR. I'm the only mechanical engineer, and work on air, space and ground equipment, so the job couldn't be broader. There's also an electrical/electronics engineer, controls guy, physics guy, project manager. I expected that the tasks would be challenging when I took the job. I expected that I'd need to put in long hours. My concern is not the workload; it's that what is expected of me is off by an order of magnitude or more.   There is a detailed design review in less than 6 weeks, for a mechanical assembly. There are a few challenges;   - It needs to perform better and be lighter and perform in a harsher environment than the best available COTS items.   - It's got to also hold dozens of electronic and electrical components whose interfaces are not defined.   - They want it designed, manufactured and tested in the next four months (from blank slate). It seems they already decided on a material and a geometry before I got here; the problem is that they are set on building it out of a shit material, and a concept geometry they have their hearts set on is ridiculous, and the interface to the platform is undefined.   - They want it mounted unconventionally to an airborne platform, in a way which I can find has never been demonstrated, and have already decided it will be a cakewalk to do.  The task isn't impossible, but when I told them that a regular company would have a team, and probably 6 months to a year to develop this, and a different concept, my comments were dismissed, e.g. \"It's only a...\", \"it's not as complicated as a ...\". And repeatedly \"it's just a development model, not a production model\".  It's precisely as if their vague opinions or ideas or cigarette packet drawings have as much weight as my analysis. Yet I have to constantly introduce terms like 'fatigue', 'strain', 'FMEA', 'modal analysis' and 'structural rigidity'.  The funniest part is a plan for the mechanical design, CAD and analysis of a space structure to take 1 week, and the mechanical design, CAD and analysis for an airborne structure to take the following week.

{"post_id": "f2iatq", "domain": "changemyview_validation", "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "history": "CMV: Washington D.C. needs to do something about its homeless and panhandling problem before it becomes unmanageable like in San Francisco The first thing I need to say is that I'm by no means an expert in policies used to manage homelessness crises. For that reason this post is going to be pretty vague in terms of what those solutions are. In my ideal world those solutions would be ethical, progressive, and would not involve forcing these people to move far away just for the sake of getting them out of the city. I know there is an extremely bad vibe around the name of this policy, but I suppose the bet solution that I can think of is something like a much less aggressive, racist, and invasive version of stop and frisk.   For some context, I'm the typical D.C. implant who was fortunate enough to get a job and be able to move here right out of college. I've lived in Washington for 8 months in a diverse, lively neighborhood that I really enjoy. When I got here, I kind of just assumed that a lot of homeless people was a normal part of living in a big city. Recently, however, I've had a handful of bad experiences both in my neighborhood and downtown that just annoyed the shit out of me and I could imagine if I weren't a fairly big guy, would make me feel unsafe.    There are days where I feel like I can't walk 100 feet without being asked for something, whether it's someone sitting on the sidewalk with a sign, loitering outside of the neighborhood shopping center or Union Station, or even walking around approaching people just trying to get from point A to B trying to yell through pedestrians' headphones. Yesterday, I was coming home from work, and there was a man, either mentally ill or visibly intoxicated, stumbling around a busy intersection near my apartment, bumping into people and scaring little kids begging people for a lighter.   You could criticize me for having small town sensibilities, but I think I have a pretty high tolerance for just general shit going on around me. I hate NIMBYism. I would never call the cops on my neighbors when they have 25 people standing in their front yard blasting music and having a barbecue. I would never confront the motorcycle enthusiast living down the block who seems to love showing off how loud his engine is. Those battles aren't worth it to me. They belong in the neighborhood. They're entitled to do what they want on their property.   So back to the progressive version of Stop and Frisk. I think the only real solution to getting homeless people off the streets is if police are allowed to tell people they can't stand or sit in certain areas for a prolonged period of time. That doesn't even take into account the amount of streetside camps, some of which are under remote overpasses but that also are located in some of the busiest intersections in the city. Police should have been able to confront the aforementioned guy stumbling around looking for a lighter.   Because of my total lack of knowledge on how homelessness is normally dealt with, I'm probably easily impressionable to good ideas that could change my view, both from a more aggressive perspective or a progressive one. But at this point, it appears to me that the attempt to operate as a progressive city is turing public spaces in D.C. into a dirty free for all where addicts and the mentally ill are free to roam around bothering people and getting in everyone's way. I'd like to be able to walk from my house to the metro stop and then from the next stop to my office without having 10+ people begging me for money, of which I don't have any to give.

It\u2019s one thing to enforce the law and stop people from harassing others, but arbitrarily telling them to move without anything in place to take them in.  More broadly, you should spend some time looking at what DC is actually doing to form an opinion.   DC is closing some of the more egregious encampments, like they did with the Watergate site a few years ago and they are doing in NoMa now.  Meanwhile, the overall population of homeless is actually falling, 12 percent since 2015..    Now, there is a lot to debate about the efficacy of their approach vs other options, but pretty much anything works better as a solution than simply harassing people.    Underlying it all is the core problem that we need more housing in the area, both in a macro sense of constructing enough supply to meet demand to keep prices under control and the very specific sense of more shelter space.  The NIMBY problem we have isn\u2019t really about people doing what they want on their own property, it\u2019s people saying they want to do something about homelessness but then opposing shelters in their neighborhoods, which in turned delays plans to expand safe shelter space, which in turn contributes to the problem you see.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 625.0, "score_ratio": 2.5}

{"post_id": "a5bgqz", "domain": "askacademia_validation", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "history": "I got into a really nasty argument with my professor, and I'm not sure what to do about it. Advice? (Warning: Long; TLDR included) I'll do my best to keep this brief. I feel like this situation needs a lot of background to understand, however, I will include a TLDR at the bottom.  I'm a junior studying Philosophy, and I just switched to the program. I loved everything about this semester, except that I have had a professor that I absolutely could not stand. On the surface, he is a nice, personable person; he's easy to talk to, and he is obviously passionate about the subjects he knows about because he could literally go on for hours if you let him. However, when I got to his class, a 1000 level Elementary Logic class, his personality seemed to change completely.   For my program, Elementary Logic is a needed class, but not necessarily a prerequisite for any other classes. There were other majors in our class, in fact, I believe I was the only Philosophy student. From day one he berated the students multiple times for not reading the book, despite his teaching strategy being pulling up the book and reading the passages to the class. (Of course students aren't going to read the book if you're just going to read it to them anyway...) I got the impression that he didn't really know the material either, despite claiming he'd taught this class for fifteen years.   I'm fairly studious, I did read the book and understood the material fairly quickly. To be honest, I found it easier to teach myself the material versus paying attention in class because this professor had a tendency to drift off topic for most of the class. I chose to sit back and let others lead discussions because I felt like I didn't need it as much as the other students. He, however, took this as me not caring and would get on to me several times for not \"paying attention,\" even though it was clear through my grades and participation that I clearly understood the material.   He had a tendency to use the word \"fucking\" a lot. I'm not sure if he was trying to be funny, but it just seemed rude and unprofessional. My final straw was when the students were struggling to understand a concept that we had just learned, he shouted to the class \"come on, this isn't fucking rocket science, you should all know this!!\" I just got up and left at that point. I couldn't take it anymore.   I had told myself that I could learn the material on my own because that was essentially what I had been doing up to this point. However, I had some personal problems in the middle of the semester that really affected my attendance and performance in my classes as a whole, and this class just sort of came last in my list of priorities. In hindsight, I should have just withdrawn from the class, but I wasn't really thinking at this point and I continued to live in the fantasy that I could do it.   I would run into this professor a couple times over the course of the semester. He would always ignore me until I spoke up and said hello, and he would get on to me for not being in his class, which is a fair reaction. I got the sense that he was personally hurt by my choice to not show up, which again, is fair, but I'm sure I'm not the only student in the world who's just never shown up to class.   Come to the end of the semester, I've sort of accepted the fact that I was going to fail, but I was aware that the class was offered in the summer online and I figured I would take the class again to get rid of the failing grade. I sent an email to this professor to apologize for my poor performance, told him I understood the consequences of my actions, admitted to being a little cocky when it came to learning the material, and thanked him for his attempts to get me to get me to pass, and informed him of my plans to retake the course at a later date. I never heard back.   On the last day of classes, a friend needed to stop by his office, so I took that opportunity to apologize in person. He, of course, goes through berating me again. I allowed him to because again, I should be held accountable for my actions. I told him that I understood that I deserved a failing grade and I would just retake the class at a later date. He accused me of \"self-flagellation\" and that I was trying to play the pity card, which was not my intention. He then shut the door and pulled out my grades and said that he was willing to fudge the numbers to get me to pass with a D. I told him that I didn't feel comfortable accepting that offer because I didn't show up to 75% of the classes. I truly believed that I deserved a failing grade, and I was okay with that. He kept throwing numbers at me, saying that if he did this, tweaked that, dropped two grades he could get me to pass, and I just kept reiterating that I appreciate his efforts but I wasn't willing to accept it. He wouldn't let me leave, either. I tried to excuse myself and he snapped \"I'm not done talking to you yet!\"  I got frustrated and snapped back \"At this point I feel like you're doing this more for you than for me\" to which he admitted that maybe he was. I figured that was the end of the discussion, but he still wouldn't let me leave, going as far as to block my way to get out of his office. This is when it got personal. He said that if I couldn't handle this class, I might as well not be able to handle college and that I might as well drop out (despite the fact that my grades in my other five classes were all As.) He called me a bad student, stupid for what I was doing, etc etc etc. I stopped arguing at this point and just let him talk, and finally found my way out of his office.   I'm not sure what to do. I've talked to other students about this professor and they all say that he's great, so nice, that he always helped them when they weren't doing well in his class, probably by tweaking grades. I'm maybe a bit too serious about education, especially a basic 1000 level class, but it's against my moral code to accept something I feel don't deserve. There's nothing wrong with helping your students along when they struggle, but I felt like he did it a little too much. I seem to be the only student who had a problem with him, however. I am not going to ask my other professors about it because I don't want to put them in that position.  Again, as a person, he's nice dude. It was just in a professional environment that I felt uncomfortable around him.  I forgot to mention that this professor happens to be my advisor, the only advisor for the philosophy department. After this altercation, I'm really uncomfortable having to see him again, let alone be at his mercy when it comes to handling my academic career.  Maybe I'm being a little dramatic, but I just have a bad feeling about all of this.   I was just going to let his behavior slide for the most part, but after that argument, I feel like I need to inform someone. I've thought about going to the dean to talk about it, but I'm not sure that my feelings of being uncomfortable are grounds for possibly costing this guy his job.

TLDR: My professor, who also happens to be my only advisor, took it personally that I didn't come to his class anymore. I refused to go because I found his behavior rude and immature. When I tried to make amends he berated me, called me a bad student, and said that I was better off dropping out despite him knowing that I was excelling in all my other classes.

I wasn't sure whether here, or r/gradschool, or even an LGBT+-specific subreddit would be best. If it's better to crosspost or just submit elsewhere instead, I'd appreciate the heads up.  So, I'm a first-year student in a really great English PhD program, having just finished my first semester. I'm also nonbinary, and use they/them pronouns. This information is public: in the list of new students/areas of interest shared with faculty at the beginning of the year, in my in-class \"icebreakers,\" and, for when things took place over Zoom, immediately after my name. Unfortunately, every single professor I worked with--both as a student and a TA--referred to me as \"he\" and \"him.\" Even one or two students made the same error. One particularly embarrassing instance of this happened where the moderator for a panel at a conference I participated in a couple months back read my author bio, but substituted in \"he\" and \"him\" for all places where I wrote \"they\" and them.\"  The trouble I'm having, naturally, is how best to go about this as I go into my next semester and beyond. Up to now, I've elected to say nothing to these people, either publicly or privately. I'm temperamentally a bit more reserved, and I object, ethically, to doing any sort of aggressive \"calling out\" or, even worse, pursuing institutional action. My temperament and ethics aside, my status as a first-year early in my career contributes to my feeling troubled: though my work draws quite a bit on queer theory, I nevertheless fear either conscious or unconscious retaliation for directly taking things up with the professors individually. This is compounded by my being a bit of an outsider to the \"culture\"--only one of my parents went to college, and even then as a late adult--and having gotten into this program off the waitlist. There's definitely a feeling like I still need to prove I belong here.  That said, I also know the situation is untenable. At first, I decided I would say nothing and use who respected what I asked for as a bellwether of their safety and compatibility viz. mentorship, but since every person of authority I interacted with this semester failed to do so, I know something needs to change. Moreover, I also still believe the onus is on me to self-advocate.  So, that's basically where I'm at. I want to--and think I need to--assert this part of my identity, one that I embraced explicitly as part of my admissions material and one I've still been open about when I got here (whether people cared to listen or not).

{"post_id": "uid5xp", "domain": "changemyview_validation", "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "history": "CMV: It is reasonable to segregate athletes by sex rather than gender There is something I do not understand about the debate about transgender people in sports.   I believe that most transgender people and allies agree that _sex_ and _gender_ are distinct things.   As I understand it, _sex_ refers to biological differences related to reproduction (e.g. pregnancy, lactation) and other physiological differences linked to it (e.g. size), whereas _gender_ refers to a set of social norms and expectations that are _associated with sex but not inextricably tied to it_.  By default, cisgender people identify as the gender that \"matches\" their sex, whereas most transgender people identify as the gender that \"mismatches\" their sex.   I seem to recall having heard one trans person say that the terms _male/female_ should be used to refer to _sex_ and that the terms _man/woman_ should be used to refer to _gender_. I don't know how widely accepted this terminological distinction is.   A number of transgender people want to compete in sports alongside athletes of the same gender.   But it seems to me that the segregation of athletes has little to do with social norms and everything to do with physiology. In other words, athletes are segregated not by _gender_ but by _sex_.  Most transwomen are women by gender but male by sex. If we view the segregation of athletes as one of sex, it ought to be reasonable that transwomen compete alongside cis men.  (Transmen who have transitioned medically may present a special problem. I do not know of any good solution to that.)  It is possible that I misunderstand something regarding what sex and gender is supposed to be. If you think so, CMV.", "c_root_id_A": "i7cdbc3", "c_root_id_B": "i7bpz3f", "created_at_utc_A": 1651698687, "created_at_utc_B": 1651689601, "score_A": 44, "score_B": 13, "human_ref_A": "In actuality, elite sports are generally not segregated by either sex or gender, but by ad-hoc rules. Let's take World Athletics, for example:  Looking at the World Athletics rules, eligibility for the male and female categories is defined as follows (C2.1, Technical Rules):  > \"3.4 An athlete shall be eligible to compete in men's (or universal) competition if they were either born and, throughout their life, have always been recognised as a male or comply with the applicable Regulations issued pursuant to Rule 3.6.1 of the Technical Rules and are eligible to compete under the Rules and Regulations.  > \"3.5 An athlete shall be eligible to compete in women's (or universal) competition if they were either born and, throughout their life, have always been recognised as a female or comply with the applicable Regulations issued pursuant to Rule 3.6.2 of the Technical Rules and are eligible to compete under the Rules and Regulations.\"  (Rules 3.6.1 and 3.6.2 are about transgender athletes and we can ignore these for now.)  What you will first observe is that (1) the rules are rather vague (what exactly does \"being born male/female\" or \"been recognised as a male/female\" mean?) and (2) is a mix of biological and social/legal criteria.  But generally, we can assume for the sake of this discussion that \"being born male/female\" refers to assigned sex and that being \"recognized as a male/female\" has some relation to legal sex. And this problem exists because historically, sex categories were motivated by plain old sexism, more concerned with keeping women out of men's spaces than caring about fairness in women's sports. For example, when Madge Syers won the (mixed) world championship in figure skating in 1902, women were promptly banned from the world championships and the sport became segregated:  > Syers' entry into the World Championships prompted the ISU to discuss the subject of women competing against men at their next Congress in 1903. The concerns raised were that \"(1) the dress prevents the judges from seeing the feet; (2) a judge might judge a girl to whom he was attached; and (3) it is difficult to compare women with men.\" To address the concerns of the ISU, Syers started the trend of wearing calf-length skirts so judges could see her foot work. The Congress voted six to three in favour of barring women from the championships.  Women's soccer was at times entirely banned in some countries (England, Germany) during the 20th century because ... well, men thought that women shouldn't do that. Because the game was not \"fitted for females\" or \"this combative sport is fundamentally foreign to the nature of women\". It wasn't until some 50 years ago that these bans were lifted.  A modern day example of sexism in sports is that of Zhang Shan, who won gold in skeet shooting at the 1992 Olympics, when skeet shooting was a mixed event. The consequences were as follows:  > This event had been mixed, open to both men and women, since it was introduced to the olympics in 1968. Zhang Shan's 1992 gold was the first medal won by a woman in this mixed event. The International Shooting Union consequently barred women from the 1996 Atlanta games. For the 2000 Sydney games, the International Olympic committee allowed women again, but only in segregated competition.  So ... while nowadays fairness and safety concerns also play a role, there's a long history of sexism and male insecurities (there are more examples) that lead to sex segregation being based on more than just biological fairness and safety concerns. Nowadays, with sex segregation being enshrined both in international organizations and sports communities, it's difficult to change it even if wanted to.  With that said, the first problem right now \u2013 before we even consider trans athletes \u2013 is that we are shoehorning intersex athletes (or female athletes that have elevated testosterone levels for other reasons) into a binary scheme that is correlated with, but not dependent on competitive advantages related to sex differentiation. We also allow men (but not women) with low levels of testosterone to take exogenous testosterone to bring them up to par with the normal testosterone levels in cis men. Oh, and sex assignment can be pretty arbitrary and now think what this means for a country like China that literally engineers its most promising athletes from birth to win medals.  If you ever wondered why Caster Semenya has created so much trouble for World Athletics (formerly the IAAF), it's exactly the problem that \"sex\" is so ill-defined^(1). She's got hyperandrogenism, but she also meets the requirements for the female category to a tee; born female, recognized as female throughout her life, check and check.  World Athletics had no way to ban intersex athletes purely because they were born this way; the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) agreed in Chand v. IFA and IAAF that you couldn't ban intersex athletes with hyperandrogenism just because they were born this way, but agreed to make eligibility of women with hyperandrogenism subject to a hormone suppression regime in Semenya v. IAAF, provided that it could be proved that such athletes had otherwise an unfair advantage. Also, those restrictions only applied to athletes participating in so-called restricted events, \"400m races, 400m hurdles races, 800m races, 1500m races, one mile races, and all other Track Events over distances between 400m and one mile (inclusive), whether run alone or as part of a relay event or a Combined Event.\" (Chapter C3.6 of the World Athletics regulations.) Outside of those, cis women can have whatever testosterone levels they naturally have, even if they are well into the male range. No restrictions on testosterone levels during puberty were required, either, even for restricted events.  And that's the general problem you are dealing with. Sex categories aren't per se related to physiological performance characteristics. You can absolutely have cis women with male-typical testosterone levels, which on average provide you with a competitive edge similar to that that cis men have. And before you start talking about chromosomes, you can in fact have XX chromosomes, female reproductive organs, and male-typical testosterone levels, as in this case report of an elite youth soccer player.  The idea that men and women form two distinct (rather than overlapping) categories for purposes of sports is nothing but a polite fiction.  And finally, we have the funny situation that trans women are currently generally subject to *stricter* regulations than cis women with hyperandrogenism.  The whole situation is an inglorious mess simply because the way we structure sex categories and the way physiological differences in men and women develop on average are strongly correlated, but are still different, and that matters especially in elite sports when we deal with people who operate outside normal human biological norms.  This is and will remain a difficult problem for the foreseeable future, regardless of what you do about trans athletes, because even cis athletes do not neatly fit in two separate boxes.  ^1 And if you think World Athletics has a problem, FIFA is much worse. FIFA rules do not even say how they define men and women, just that only men can participate in men's competitions and only women can participate in women's competition. The decision is left to an expert panel, but the regulations are vague enough to support pretty much any decision that the panel wants to arrive at for whatever reasons (including political ones). But FIFA is also an exceedingly corrupt organization, so it's perhaps not surprising that they don't like justiciable criteria.", "human_ref_B": "I think it would be worth clarifying what exactly you mean by segregating athletes by sex.

I have had serious depression issues all my life, and am being medicated for them for a few years now. The meds arrangement I have isn't great, but it's better than nothing I guess.  Recently, I've found myself questioning if I am really meant for this. I love research, reading and writing papers, but I am hitting the point where I have no happiness anymore in my life anymore. The things I used to love, that I used to continue going on, are becoming more and more difficult to do. It's at the point that even though academics are one of the few things that are keeping me going, my mental distress is now preventing me from being able to make the most basic progress possible.  My long-term girlfriend recently decided that she doesn't think our lives are going to be going the same direction and wants to end things so she doesn't prevent me from having the life I typically thought I would have (family with kids, etc.).

My main realization is I don't think academia is meant for someone like me. I'm soft, sensitive, just searching for a glimmer of happiness, and I feel like all I find in academics is isolation and loneliness. I feel absolutely lost because I just about hate everything else I could do with my degree except academia (engineering, but all the jobs I am best suited for are programming-related related, which I don't particularly enjoy).  Here is my issue - What now? If I don't go on in academia, I have no idea what the hell I'll ever do. I don't feel mentally OK. I don't feel like I can have a job, a life like some people. Quite frankly, I feel like, aside from academia, I don't have a place in the world. But it seems like now I am losing my ability to even do that.

My background is in biomedical research, and I'm currently a research scientist, applying for TT positions. I've been struggling with the idea of training my own graduate students and for years now I've been reluctant to encourage undergraduates to continue on to grad school. Every time an undergraduate research assistant has expressed interest in pursuing a PhD, I've tried to explain to them the enormity of the deck stacked against them. To wit:  * Compared to other highly educated people in the general population, PhD students are about 2.5 times more likely to be at risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders.  About one in three end up with symptoms of a psychiatric disorder.   * For 80% of grad students, an academic career is the goal, but just over 10% actually achieve a faculty position. And those 10% are not equally distributed across institutions, but disproportionately come from elite institutions 1-3], the kinds of which I will most likely not be teaching at.  * [Most biomedical PhDs end up having to do a postdoc, but postdoc salaries are lower than that of a new college graduate even though the postdoc is working 50+ hours per week and is 9 years older than the new college grad.   * 20% of postdocs report having existential crises related to their careers.  * If the postdoc goes into industry, their salary (~$48K/yr )  is still less than the median new college grad (~50K/yr) AND it's unlikely the private sector biology PhD will be able to continue doing research 4-5]. Indeed, if the postdoc sticks with research, they can expect to be paid [less.   * Moreover, several studies agree that there isn\u2019t any evidence a postdoc will actually benefit seekers of non-academic jobs 6-8]. When comparing private sector workers 10 years post-PhD, the salary of those who went the postdoc route are [$12,000 lower than those who skipped postdocs altogether.   So if I encourage someone to go to grad school, I'm essentially putting them on a path toward some pretty dire consequences for their career, especially if they do a postdoc, which most will. If they're not getting paid well, they're not getting training that can help them thrive outside of academia, and they're miserable, how can I justify telling them to go this route?   I think I'm a pretty good mentor. I think my research is important. But I'm realistic about the prospects of my trainees. They're not all going to end up in tenured faculty positions, and the numbers concerning the alternatives are all pretty grim. I can try my best to make sure my students aren't stressed out horribly, but I can't do anything to ensure they'll have meaningful, fulfilling jobs in science that actually pay enough to make grad school worthwhile.   So how do you do it? How do we as mentors look our students in the eyes and tell them to ignore the statistics and persevere, hoping they'll be one of the few to buck the trends?

I think the best analogies for my case is the fat guy that keeps going to the gym, but can't drop a pound, because he always \"rewards himself with a burger / fries / cake\" or the lottery millionaires who win millions then find themselves broke in an year or two.   In fact, let's keep talking about the lottery millionaires, just like the fat guy at the gym, he has poor discipline and self-control. He has money and he frivolously spends them - it doesn't matter if it's 10$ or 1 000 000$ - they will be spent on things that would provide no return on investment (like opening a business or education or heck, even bribing your manager).  So you provide a safety net or some other type of welfare program, so now the \"poor folk\" save 100$ or 200$ or however much the program saves them, but instead of using that money to better their lives on the long-term, they dump them in a new expensive bag, shoes, first-class tickets to a match or what-have-you.   My point is that creating massive welfare programs isn't going to stop poverty, no amount of government interference would ever erase poverty. In fact, there'll always be a large group (dare I say majority) of \"working class\" who are stuck in their position not because of the lack of hard work or talent, but because they have absolutely no self-control when it comes to spending. And there's nothing other people or the government could do to help them unless they help themselves.  Some people do get out, but they usually do through good use of money.

How to find the best case scenario, the worst case scenario, the average case scenario and just about everything about an algorithm. Apart from this it will teach you about data structures, optimization, searching, sorting, binary trees, trees, hashing, etc... just about anything that comes with the logic behind a computer algorithm and how they work. This also has some code so you can replicate it and test it yourself or implement it on something you are working on.  Field and Wave Electromagnetics by David K. Cheng. This book is pretty much for electrical engineering but it helps you understand calculus in a whole new way for real world scenarios, apart from that you will have never known \"real\" calculus until you saw this. Its great because it will get your brain to do more complex things, it will push you to new boundaries of thinking and get you to understand how magnets, electricity, dipoles, waves, eddy currents, inductors, capacitors, etc, work in a physical level with real math and physics to back them up.  If you are a mechanical or aerospace engineer I would highly recommend anything with statics and dynamics, thermodynamics, aerodynamics/fluid dynamics.  Finally I would also cover something with statistics and probabilities.   This will take a while to cover but let me tell you, you will be the best engineer if you are able to just cover the first 4 books and some classical physics with dynamics. But if you fully understand calculus, linear algebra, algorithm logic, and statistics \\(I would also see the electromagnetics book to see examples of harder math and everything worked out symbolically rather than your average plug and chug and find the answer through working with numbers\\), then you will be a top tier Engineer.

Eventually they settled on the fact I used the term \"manchild\". That is an insult worthy of a permanent ban in their eyes.   In my experience, you cannot get bans overturned on Reddit, even when it's a minor innocuous infraction like this. Every single subreddit has at least one mod, if not more, who is solely there for power tripping rather than wanting to actually make a subreddit better.

Let's say that we did in fact replace all mods of the mentioned sub with bots and kept the rule of no insults in place.  Now we need a full list of all the possible insults (and all their (mis)spellings) to give to this bot so this rule can be enforced.  Remember, computers don't understand what we say.  To them a sentence like \"he said that all people who shoot themselves in the foot are idiots\" and \"you are an absolute idiot\" are pretty much the same.  The computer doesn't understand that the first one is paraphrasing and the second is actually calling an idiot.

{"post_id": "qc9nso", "domain": "legaladvice_validation", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "history": "Can I stop the county sheriff's office from using my property for a speed trap? Three months ago, I bought a parcel of land with a house on it in a rural area in Oregon along a state highway. Before I bought it, I had two separate surveys done (long story, but they were identical) so I know exactly where my property line is. The layout is a bit difficult to describe, so I made this MS Paint drawing to show what it looks like.  For the first month or so after moving onto the property, about 1/3 of the days I got back from work, there would be a traffic stop in progress just down the road from my driveway. I thought it was weird but I didn\u2019t make the connection until later that there was a speed trap further up the road.  Also during the first month, I noticed that the driveway to the upper part of my property was worn down. It\u2019s pretty overgrown because it just leads to a little clearing in the forest, no buildings or structures, and there\u2019s also a path from my house to this area, so I never use it and the previous owner didn\u2019t either. But it looked like several people had driven a little ways up the road. I didn\u2019t want random people driving up there, so I had some large rocks put in to block the entrance from the highway. They were easily big enough to see, and couldn\u2019t be driven over accidentally, and were about 20 feet from the actual road. That was just before I left for about ten days to visit some family.  When I got back, the rocks were gone. I called the sheriff\u2019s office to report the theft, because those rocks were kind of expensive, and it turns out the sheriff\u2019s office had removed them because they were \u201cencumbering the flow of traffic\u201d on the highway. This is totally untrue, because they weren\u2019t even close to the road and were fully on my property. They only blocked access to the upper part of my property. But I didn\u2019t know how to argue about it with the sheriff\u2019s office, so I decided to put new rocks in, but further up the driveway this time.  I arranged for the same guy as before to put in the new rocks but when I walked up to meet him, I found a sheriff\u2019s deputy parked in the driveway, about thirty feet from the highway. My guess is he was trying to make sure drivers on the highway couldn\u2019t see him from up or down the road until they drove by. I asked him to leave because he was on my property, and I was about to have the driveway blocked off. He said he would leave, but I couldn\u2019t block the driveway off because the sheriff\u2019s office uses it for traffic enforcement purposes. When the guy I hired showed up, the deputy made him leave and told me that if the driveway was blocked again, they could charge me with obstruction.  I feel like that\u2019s total bs, but when I called the sheriff\u2019s office to complain about them using my driveway for a speed trap and about the deputy\u2019s attitude, they also told me that I wasn\u2019t allowed to block off my driveway if it\u2019s being used for law enforcement purposes.  I fully acknowledge that the next few things I did were escalations, but at the time I didn\u2019t feel like I was doing anything wrong (and tbh I still don\u2019t).  I put up signs (purple dots on the Paint map) at both ends of my property warning about a speed trap, and I put up no trespassing signs up at the entrance to that back driveway. I\u2019ve also been allowed to work from home most days for the last six weeks, so I started taking pleasant walks every two hours or so up to the back driveway to see if there were any deputies parked there. Seventeen times so far, there has been a deputy there and each of those times I told them they were on private property and asked them to leave. Each time they did, but they\u2019ve gotten increasingly aggressive about it as time has gone on. I\u2019ve called the sheriff\u2019s office a few times to complain again, but each time they told me that it was allowed and that I should stop calling to complain. So I stopped after the first two weeks.  On Monday, I told THREE separate deputies to leave my property. I admit I was angry on the third time, and when the deputy got pissy, I told him to just f\\*ck off and not come back. He got angry at that and yelled at me about disrespect before leaving.  I have made short notes after each time I talked with a deputy (date and time, and what was said) but given the incident on Monday, I was considering starting to film the incidents too.  But it seems to have peaked yesterday when I got a visit at home from the sheriff. Yes, the elected sheriff. He had both of the speed trap warning signs with him, and he told me if I kept obstructing their traffic enforcement and kept harassing his deputies, they would charge me. He yelled at me for a few minutes before I told him to leave.  My question is basically, am I allowed to do what I\u2019m doing? Can I put the warning signs back up and keep telling the deputies to get off my property? Am I really not allowed to block the entrance to my back driveway? Should I stop everything I\u2019m doing before I get charged with something?

For your sake I wouldn\u2019t put the warning signs back up. I wouldn\u2019t engage with the deputies other than asking them politely to leave your property.   Make sure your property is correctly posted with no-trespassing signs according to your jurisdiction.  Then I\u2019d reach out to a lawyer to figure out how to proceed with getting the cops to stop using your property without permission.

I happen to live in a \"buyer beware\" state, which means if we buy, we are SOL and stuck to whatever we agreed upon. Are you in a state like that? Honestly, my first thought is that your inspector is liable for letting that pass. We've noticed that the inspectors we have used are incredibly observant, detailed, and thorough. For example, there was a crack in the driveway of a house we looked at months ago. There were little things here and there. The retaining walls looked like they were coming apart. One might not put all of that together per say, but the crack in the concrete ran into the garage and the retaining wall in need of most repair was on the same side of that house. It was at the top of a hill... The house was only 25 yo, but that's a significant problem because the house may continue to split and slide. The roof also was as old as the house. To the naked eye, it didn't look bad, but up close you could see that there were no granules left on the shingles. Prior to the inspection, we didn't notice these issues. The listing agent told us there had been a previous contract where the financing fell through, but they had had an inspection done and the roof was fiiiiiiine. She said we might find a few things here and there. She also told us that both HVAC s were less than 5 yo. The truth was she's a liar... one HVAC was 5 and one was 7yo and the 7 yo one needed work. I don't know the exact total of all of the things the inspector listed because there were so many, but they were color coded by what needed repairs ... Red-dire, yellow-concerning, green- may need inspection from a professional. Something is that nature. We chose 30 of the dire issues (there were more, but we chose the worst). We sent it to the listing agent, to which she said to our agent, \"are they serious with this?\" I am SO thankful that we found such an amazing group of inspectors. That house looked move in ready and it seriously wasn't. If that inspector had missed those things and we had bought the house, we wouldn't be able to recover any money from the previous owner, but I certainly would have turned to the inspector and looked to get some sort of restitution.

Over time, they added more and more programming functionality -- but their main audience was designers... so you had lots of designers (not programmers!) starting to do programming..   It also lowered the barrier to entry, even for programmers, by making manipulating graphics around the screen really simple.  So why does this matter?

When it comes to kids the stakes are a lot lower so it's easy to brush off the whole thing and tell them both to shut up but while that might be convenient for the adult it's very damaging for the children, because the aggressor is taught they can get anyone they want in trouble by aggressing on them and will face no more than equal consequences and might even be able to use that to extort people and like I said before the defender is taught that they should never fight back or retaliate. So instead of teaching kids that it matters who started it and thus you should never aggress on someone as they are justified in retaliating we teach them never to retaliate enabling the aggressors.", "c_root_id_A": "hk85nce", "c_root_id_B": "hk8fsxn", "created_at_utc_A": 1636652229, "created_at_utc_B": 1636656226, "score_A": 20, "score_B": 22, "human_ref_A": "The reason we say \"i don't care who started it\" is because most often both parties believe the other started it.

Fighting is incredibly dangerous, if you Google \"man killed with one punch\" you can see how often random street fights lead to the death of one person and the destroyed life of another.

(OH) Hey there internet (anonymous account for obvious reasons!). I'm moving away from the area a property I own is in, and in a few months and will no longer be able to care for it. I've had the same tenants in there for nearly 10 years and in that time, the remaining mortgage has been paid off. They are a lovely couple and have been so generous and kind to me over the last 10 years. They are clearly just good people. I would just sell the property but I don't want it to go to someone who would treat them poorly. With all the corporations buying up properties and treating them like a number and all.  I know I could continue to manage from afar but I do most of the repairs myself so it would become much more expensive upkeep wise.

I'm a lonely older guy and have more than enough money in retirement and savings to be perfectly happy for the rest of my life. I feel like this family could benefit from not having to worry about rent any more and while I could just reduce the rent to next to nothing, I honestly would rather it just be in their name.

I don\u2019t really want to debate the effectiveness or necessity of dress codes here, as that\u2019s a conversation for another time. Suffice to say, most high schools have them, and most cheerleading uniforms don\u2019t even come close to meeting the requirements.   The reasoning behind dress codes is one of a few things.   1. It\u2019s inappropriate for teenagers to dress a certain way.   2. It\u2019s distracting for teachers or other students to be exposed to immodest outfits on girls when they should be focusing on teaching/learning.   3. Students, like teachers, are supposed to remain professional and put together on school campuses.   Again, whether you think any of this is necessary is not really my point. My point is this: if everyday classroom attire must meet certain standards, shouldn\u2019t cheerleading uniforms be required to do the same? Cheerleading uniforms are much more revealing than the average student\u2019s spaghetti strap shirt or cleavage-bearing dress. Not only that, but cheerleaders are moving in such a way as to make their already revealing outfits even more immodest. Kicking, jumping, and being thrown in the air make it easier to see up their already short skirts, and the tops always seem to ride up higher. Cheerleaders wear their uniforms on game day usually, meaning that they are sitting in the same classes as other students, completely out of dress code and no one says a word. They also perform at pep rallies during school hours, making the aforementioned problems relevant. And they\u2019re also at games, which are school sanctioned events and on property.   If everyone should have to follow these rules, cheerleaders shouldn\u2019t be immune.   Disclaimer: I\u2019m not some pervy guy that has trouble not looking up cheerleader\u2019s skirts. I\u2019m actually a woman. And I also have no problem with cheerleaders or cheerleader uniforms. Though I was not a cheerleader myself, I knew and was friends with many of them. A lot of them even agreed with me here, and others I knew for a fact were cheerleaders largely because they enjoyed dressing this way and it was a way to exploit the system.

The same process is occurring with energy production, transportation, computing, etc.  Left to its own devices, capitalism (coupled with first-world desire to \u201csave the planet,\u201d throupled with capitalism bringing more people out of extreme poverty and into the first world) will continue to drive innovation in all relevant fields, driving down emissions.   As it stands, the fact is that if we covered every inch of the planet with solar panels (and had a way of storing all that energy) the planet would freeze over. If we built massive water towers every few blocks over land and filled them, the sea-level would drop dramatically. If we grew ludicrous amounts of plants and/or algae, we could convert most of atmospheric CO2 into oxygen. We also have ways of using energy to convert CO2 into useful materials. If solar (or other green energy) can produce the power to convert CO2 into useful materials, with the rest of the energy from peak productive hours being used to pump water into water towers (which can be released during non-peak hours to spin turbines and generate electricity), and all this can be done efficiently enough to make it *profitable*, then it is solved.   All we need is for there to be sufficient efficiency in all aspects of production, sufficient demand for both the climate solution and the products converted from CO2, and for all the parts of the solution to align properly.", "human_ref_B": "Capitalism is the most efficient system ever devised for exploiting natural resources to meet human demand for things.  If you eliminate capitalism, you will still have human demand for things, so you will still have natural resources being exploited just in a less efficient manor.  Not less efficient in exploiting the resource, just less efficient in turning the resource into a demand-meeting item.  Currently, there is no system for energy conversion that can sustain the amount of human life currently on the planet without causing severe, climate altering consequences.  There are only two options for solving climate change.  First is the elimination of a huge portion of human life.    Second is developing an energy system that can handle the energy needs of an ever increasing human population.  If capitalism is eliminated, the chance of option two coming to fruition will be substantially decreased.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 25053.0, "score_ratio": 1.5}

Ignoring low performance aircraft (i.e., piston powered) for a moment, an aircraft's flight envelope - which measures its limits of performance - are typically measured in Mach numbers and air pressure. Mach number is a lot more important than absolute air speed once you start to approach (and exceed) the speed of sound, and other comments have explained why.  At low altitudes and low speeds, absolute air speed and absolute altitude are more important for a variety of reasons. And at low altitudes and low speeds generally aircraft instruments report on airspeed and altitude (either with a radar altimeter or with a barometric altimeter adjusted to the local sea level air pressure). At high speeds most aircraft instruments will switch over to reporting Mach number, and at high altitudes aircraft switch their barometric altimeters to a standardized setting which really means they start measuring air pressure instead of altitude. So an aircraft flying at, e.g., 0.8mach at 30,000 feet is measuring its key flight envelope parameters directly.  At low speeds aerodynamic performance is dictated more by absolute airspeed (really important for initial climb performance) and there are also regulatory controls around absolute airspeed as well (ATC clearances during departure, and the 10,000 foot 250 knot speed limit). And at low altitudes you want to make sure you don't hit anything attached to the actual ground.   Low performance aircraft will typically only measure their airspeed in knots, since they never get fast enough for Mach to become more important.  Ultimately you can use any set of figures in your calculations, so long as you're including all the appropriate factors. Aircraft instruments report numbers that are most useful to the pilots at any given time and require the least amount of mental arithmetic / conversion at critical points in the flight.", "human_ref_B": "The mach number is just (object velocity / speed of sound).

Not clear why you think the speed of sound would be different for each point on a body. That is determined by the medium (air, water), pressure, and temperature.

It would be much better to tell the employees trying to reverse engineer it \"you can't use data from this source\" and then give them a few of the competing designs to measure/analyze/characterize, etc.  Is the other company a competitor or one that your company has had dealings with? That's the only reason I could see doing reverse engineering and not telling the engineers about the existing product as it would help shield your company from the inevitable litigation.  To be clear: There is absolutely nothing illegal about a company purchasing another company's product and trying to copy it. You would only run into legal troubles if the design had current patents on it or you used proprietary (non-public) information obtained on the original product to create your copy of it (even if that information was obtained legally through things like licensing or via supplier/manufacturer relationship).  It's very shitty of your company to hire people under the guise of creating a new design when it appears that *someone* at your company knows that you are all really just reverse engineering an existing design.", "human_ref_B": "are you sure its the same exact product?

Here are just a few reasons I've seen students bump up against the hidden curriculum and fail out or not get academic jobs. As a dissertation committee member, I've always tried to help, but I can only be outside reader because my program doesn't have grad students and there's only so much I can do. I hate to say it but a lot of my advice is about pretending to be middle class--not upper or lower, either is a disadvantage. Academics have cultural capital but will live a very modest life, so showing off a lot of wealth does not leave any better impression than being openly working class. That said, I think academia SHOULD be for everyone. As someone with a non-wealthy background myself, I'm very aware that it isn't in its current form.  &#x200B;  Here are the issues I've seen personally or with my students:  &#x200B;  1. The first isn't about class, but it is about hidden curriculum. It is very common for failures to result from mismatched expectations for master's / PhD qualifying exams. If you're a student, make sure you know what a successful exam performance is like. If there's something specific you'll be producing, like a close reading of a literary text, ask for a successful sample. 2. The second is also hidden curriculum, but not class. Make sure you know citation practices in your field. These are supposed to be taught in undergrad and will not be retaught in the grad curriculum in a lot of detail, but you probably didn't learn them adequately as an undergrad. I've seen unintentional plagiarism on a dissertation and it was painful to unravel. Student was from a different country and misunderstood what her graduate instructors said about citation. 3. And on to class...a lot of interviewing for jobs is communication and language skills. I am in a foreign language field, so those skills need to be bilingual. You need to sound like a respectable middle class person in both languages, and some of that is about vocabulary, intonation and pronunciation. If you have a regional or foreign accent (I do, so I know), having very correct grammar and fancy vocabulary can offset a negative impression. 4. Students and job candidates can have little idea of what a professor's day-to-day work is like. This is a more acute problem if, say, neither your parents nor your parents' friends are academics, so you have no real-life models to follow. Get out all your questions with the faculty in your PhD program. It's always an odd experience when a job candidate asks me who makes the syllabus and the tests (the professor does!). These questions are natural and common from people who haven't done a lot of teaching or who have taught at large universities that heavily coordinate sections of the same course. 5. Dressing and looking middle class is key to getting that job. I hate that this is the case because academia should be for everyone with the interest and intellectual spark. I finally had success getting a job when I changed my style from more casual to what my image of a \"career woman\" was (shoulder-length straightened hair, makeup, clothes from Banana Republic and Ann Taylor, black shoes with a short heel, no nail polish). In my case I dressed up for the entire year I was a Visiting Assistant Professor and I got hired when the tenure track job came up. I wore my suit at least once a week! Slowly over time I reverted to my former style (crazy nail polish, long curly hair, no makeup, jeans and black tee shirts, Birkenstocks with socks). My students never cared, and my fellow faculty is now used to the fact that I buy my clothes at Costco and don't put makeup on my face. But actually getting the job is at least in part about appearances.", "human_ref_B": "Absolutely yes there is. The book Limbo: Blue-Collar Roots, White-Collar Dreams by Alfred Lubrano was helpful for me in understanding and navigating the upper class world that is academia.    One of my big wakeups was realizing my definition of \u201cbroke\u201d was very different from others.

Be a creative problem solver (ie: I asked people what to wear to a conference and the answers were all over the place so finally I searched the previous year\u2019s hashtag on social media to see what people were really wearing).

I provided therapy to clients going through a 4-6 week intensive in-patient drug treatment program. 30-50% of our clients were mandated through drug court, meaning they were in treatment instead of going to prison for drug-related offenses (sale, DUI, domestic violence, etc.) I believe that sending people to treatment is far better than sending them to prison, but it is by no means a panacea for addiction.  What you are describing is essentially mandated treatment for those we designate as addicts, which is already common practice. The first issue with your position is the premise that there is an arbitrary line between who is an addict and who is not. The diagnosis of substance related disorders is highly subjective and based on the individual's level of functioning. There is a large grey area of substance use which may subjectively be considered as addiction or not. I won't go into a ton of detail, but depending on the assessment, criteria, and information available, the answer to the question \"are they an addict? \" can vary greatly from one professional to another. The client's self report is biased and often fraught with denial, especially in mandated clients. Collateral sources can be useful, but still biased or unreliable. Courts, significant others, and family members can give insight into a client, but they all have their own agendas and biases. An addict is not just an addict, they are a complicated human being who likely doesn't fit neatly into a box. Your post references meth and heroin, but the majority of clients in treatment are there because of alcohol, which is completely legal. I had a number of clients who were very high functioning (lawyers, financiers, small business owners) heroin users on the weekends. By what vague criteria do you propose we diagnose addiction, and why are those criteria better than those developed through years of professional research?   The second point I'd like to address is the importance of client \"buy in\" and its effect on relapse likelihood. For a client to address their addiction, they must first admit they have a problem.  You can't just force someone to recover from drug addiction by power of will or removal of privileges. The client to put in constant effort for recovery and their therapist or drug counselor simply can't do it for them. You can put them through detox to get them safely past their withdrawals, but that doesn't cure their craving or addiction behavior. You can lock them up for a month or two in treatment, tell them drugs are bad, talk about better strategies, get them a job, temporary housing, give them medicine and therapy, and send them on their way, but in they end they have to be the one to stay sober. There's no point to rehabilitation if you can't eventually trust them to make their own decisions. That said, the lifetime prevalency for relapse after treatment is as high as 90%, depending on a number of factors. As you mention, getting someone into a new environment is critically important to recovery, but it's not always enough. Permanently cutting ties with your family and  friends, being unemployed and impoverished, and struggling with mental illness all increase likelihood of relapse and are not easily overcome. Even for someone who is well adjusted and healthy, that sort of isolation is torturous. The more intrinsic motivation a client has to recover (self admitted instead of forced) the greater their likelihood of success. Similarly, having a strong support network like sober family, friends, or  NA/AA is strongly predictive of more successful sobriety. It's not rocket science. Are you more likely to do something because it's really important to you, or because it's a choice between doing it and jail?   You seem to know that taking people's freedom is inherently wrong, but are able to dismiss it with the justification that addicts don't have freedom to begin with. I find this position a bit offensive, as it is reductionist and invalidating of the struggles of real people. You're right that addicts become slaves to their substances, but that isn't the same as forfeiting their rights. When you hear the stories of addicts face to face, you realize that they are usually victims of trauma and other circumstances outside their control. They use drugs or alcohol to try to regain some control over their lives, and they themselves are often the greatest victims of their actions. They destroy their relationships, their reputations, their careers, and have their freedom taken away when they hurt others. The solution to this problem is not to take from them further, but to give them a standard to live up to. If you treat addicts as second class citizens, they act like second class citizens. If you treat them with respect and compassion, and allow them to earn back the trust of their community, you give them one or two more reasons to change.   Most of my mandated clients had no interest in changing. They either tried their best to put on a good face until they \"did their time\" and then went back to the same lifestyle, or sabotaged themselves and we kicked them back to their parole officers and courts. Some were really interested in getting their lives back together, and the threat of jail time was a big enough stick to get them headed in the right direction. Either way, we gave them all a fair chance and helped set them up as best we could for going back into \"the real world.\"  It's late, so I'm sorry if I got a bit jumbled and soapboxy at the end. I've gotten to know a lot of very flawed but inherently good people in my time, and I care a great deal about treating them with respect. Most of the people I worked with will not remain sober the rest of their lives, but a few will, and a few more will be better set to try again when they're ready.

{"post_id": "6a4bpr", "domain": "askanthropology_validation", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "history": "Why are thoughts about warefare and violence in early hunter-gatherer societies so divided? Some scientists say that H-G (hunter-gatherer) societies were egalitarian in every aspect (no social classes, sexes are equal etc). They often take example of !Kung people. !Kung people also have this kind of life philosophy which amongst other things considers any kind of violence childish.  On the other side, some say the truth is totally opposite. They say the academia draws these conslusions influenced by modern-day politics. In their opinion, violence has its roots deep in humans, so the warfare was also common between the h-g bands. Now, they take example of some (or many?) h-g peoples from Papua New Guinea, Africa, and most famous Sentinelese islands people.  So, whose side has more correct views? What are the facts (archeological) that support those views, because modern-day h-gs have been under heavy influence by agriculturalists, colonialists, or us from today's world society. So taking them as examples is not so reliable.   By googling, I found an example of 10000 years old massacre on Ethiopian platau (I think..). And it is stated that it's the (evidence for) earliest act of \"mass-violence\" yet found. But that's not so long time ago, and around that time, people start to transition to sedentary way of life in some parts of the world.   So, all these things and many others I read about h-gs on the internet, make me draw some kind of conclusion:   * Early, paleolithic h-gs were very mobile, living in small bands, having no hierachical structure in their society and were pretty egalitarian  * This was made possible because of low population density, and their lack of \"land owning\" concept  * Hence, there was not much violence within the bands, but sporadic encounters between two bands could end up violently (out of fear mostly)  * After becoming sedentary or semi-sedentary, they would need to protect their land from others, who could use up resources from their territory  * Also this would enable other hgs to pillage the sedentary ones (even though they are non violent, individal hg communities could have different set of moral and religious believes, among them violent ones)   Two qustions remain: how close is this view to the truth and why did people become sedentary?", "c_root_id_A": "dhboabc", "c_root_id_B": "dhbole2", "created_at_utc_A": 1494329140, "created_at_utc_B": 1494329820, "score_A": 2, "score_B": 13, "human_ref_A": "I don't think the question about warfare is so much about whether violence exists in all societies (it does), as much as it is about what scale violence needs to reach to be considered warfare. How many people are involved? Was this a chance encounter or was it premeditated? Are we seeing evidence of death, or are most of the victims surviving their wounds? Are the victims solely male, or are women, children, and the elderly also included? What degrees of social complexity are required?  Answering any of these questions is a bitch of a task, and good luck getting any large group of researchers to agree on how to quantify or qualify it.", "human_ref_B": "The concept of an egalitarian lifestyle is attributed to anthropologists. A significant number of archaeologists do not believe that you can apply the social organization of modern groups to groups 100,000 years ago. Much for the same reasons you mention. Some archaeologist (I have met many but I don't know how widespread this view is) discard ethnoarchaeology as a field completely.   If we look at the evidence there is not much which shows violence in the Paleolithic. But we also want to remember that we don't have that many Paleolithic remains. Specially not of the earlier species of hominids. It is extremely likely that a significant part of our view is based on this bias. But sitting around speculating does no one any good either, we have to go with what we have. Here is an article on the Shanidar 3 neanderthal, which shows some signs of potential interpersonal violence. It also discusses, or references, other similar cases. It's worth a look only to give you more to read.   On the other hand, there is definite evidence of interpersonal violence (as shown above). We know that other primates show aggression and violence. There is really nothing to indicate that violence did not occur in the Paleolithic. The question is on which scale. Simply by going with population numbers it would appear obvious that violence could never have been on a large scale by post-Neolithic standards. At least not in the sense that we find dozens and dozens of dead littering the place. Though proportionally, if a group has 12 members and 4 are killed in a raid, that's pretty significant numbers for that group. But as I said, we lack the evidence.   You also want to consider separating violence and warfare. Warfare suggests the purposeful attack on another group with the idea of making war. Is a simple raid warfare? Is one guy getting pissed off at another guy, rounding up some friends and going to kill that guy, warfare? Or does it have to be more structured? I don't know, I study plants and plants are all about peace and love. Warfare is as much as mindset as it is a result. Imagine if you have a personal vendetta against someone, you grab some friends to teach that dude a lesson. His friends get involved. Multiple people die or get injured. Archaeologically we'd probably infer that as warfare of some type. But it wasn't. So it's difficult to infer these things. My point is that you have to watch the terminology as the terminology matters. It sets your expectations.   As for your own conclusions (it's more of a hypothesis really). Point 1 is speculation based on modern groups with significant issues showing this archaeologically. In essence, the argument is that since there were no permanent structures there would be no material evidence showing hierarchy. How do we know that the person who slept in that part of the cave wasn't more important than the other and slept there because that spot was drier? We don't, we have no way of knowing that. Hierarchies are based on the material evidence, so if we don't have it how can we infer it? Absence of evidence does not equal evidence of absence, and all that. That's the argument.     Point 2 is probably wrong as land ownership would have likely occurred even among mobile groups. Although this is primarily noted in the early Neolithic where we have settlement patterns that correspond to modern groups of herders and historical accounts (you can dig in to some of Akkermans studies from Syria where he discusses Neolithic and modern nomads, just to see the point e.g. Akkermans & Schwartz (2003) The Archaeology of Syria). So we have material remains corresponding to behavior we see from similar groups today. Essentially nomads will claim an area of land as their own. They will traverse this land and go to different sites at different times for different purposes. They will force others to pay to use their land, or they will remove them through violence (or other means). We also see territorial behavior among primates. Since we know that many sites were seasonal I see no reason to discard the concept of land ownership. It's just that the expectation of land ownership is different today than it would have been.   Point 3 hinging on point 1 and 2 may then fall. Whether something is done out of fear would be 100% speculation with no possible way of proving it.   Point 4 would probably be correct. That there was a need to protect their land. But this was may true in the Paleolithic too, specially with the more complex hunter-gatherer groups. Protecting resources would possibly be important. Specially in areas with higher population pressure. I can't think of any paper to back this up, but since we know it happened in the Neolithic, we know there was population pressure in some areas, we know there was violence. It would appear reasonable, and an interesting hypothesis to test. Looking at complex hunter-gatherers, subsistence, early farmers, trying to find evidence of violence. I'd read that paper for sure. Maybe there is one?   Point 5, sure. It's entirely possible that hunter-gatherers raided early agriculturalists or pastoralists. But would it not be entirely possible that the opposite was true as well? Remember, early farmers relied hugely on hunting and gathering in addition to agriculture. Not to mention cultivators who would spend much (proportionally) of their time sedentary but certainly were also mobile. Complex hunter-gatherers is what I'm saying. As for the moral and religious believes, I refer you to Hawkes' Ladder of Inference. I am a firm believer in that it is near impossible for us to infer moral or religious believes archaeologically. So to me that would be speculation without evidence, or 100% speculation.   Why people became sedentary is a big ol' question. You can find a lot of answers to this. The primary theory as it stands is growing population, the right climate, technological advances. This led to agriculture and agriculture worked well. There are several threads on the first page of /r/askanthropology where this is discussed.   How close your hypothesis is to the truth? Probably not very. Or at least it is much more complex and nuanced than you suggest. Is it possible? Maybe. But you're going to have to find something to support it. A lot of it seems to be speculation based on your own bias and your own narrative (we're all biased). You'd likely have to do a lot of reading to back any of it up.

Australia had a similar programs to massively reduce guns in their country, and their firearm homicide rate has declined by 50% in the last couple of decades. If anyone suggested that in the United States, they would be crucified by the NRA. We can't even agree on a ban on assault weapons, let alone things like rifles, handguns, and shotguns. Meanwhile we have just had our 18th mass shooting in the last 8 years, yet our national policy on guns hasn't changed significantly.   This is just an example, but it drives home the point that the United States has such a wide range of viewpoints and political opinions that we cannot seem to move the country much in any given direction. Our immigration system remains dysfunctional because we can't agree on any significant action to change the system. Abortion is incredibly difficult in many states despite it being legal because anti-abortion people restrict access to abortion in every legal way they can.

From my understanding, Europe passed legislation requiring all cell phones in Europe to adhere to a standardized charging system, and as a result all devices in Europe must be sold with a USB-compatible charger. This is why iPhones in Europe are sold with Micro-USB adapters.   The benefits of these regulations are that they minimize waste, as before the rise of modern cell phones, every cell phone manufacturer invented their own custom charger.   My view is that this regulation does not go far enough, and an expanded version should be adopted by the US. Specifically, all handheld devices should be required to adhere to an open charging system.  Importantly: I am indifferent as to which system this should be. But one system I have come to appreciate recently are those magnetic-charging adapters that you see on Amazon and advertised all over the place, like these. Magnetic connectors are highly convenient, and can bring the advantages of USB-C and Lightning (like 2-orientation connections) to micro-USB devices. Effectively, this would work on devices ranging from laptops and tablets to headphones and smartphones.  There are, however, devices that should not be *required* to adhere to a unified charging standard. Laptops can have significant power draws. Waterproof-required devices like Smartwatches may require wireless charging. Exceptionally small devices like single-headphone headphones (such as Apple Airpods, etc) may not be able to adhere to whatever standard is adopted, and should be allowed to design there own charger.  Additionally, these standards change with frequency, so the charging standard should have planned updates with a universal adoption of a new standard every 10 years or less, preferably with backwards/forwards compatibility for one generation whenever possible.  But: If it's a smartphone, tablet or e-reader with a built in rechargeable battery, I should be able to use the same cord to charge it for a long period of time, whether that manufacturer is Apple, Samsung, Amazon, Google, or anyone else.

As an adult (to be successful) you've got responsibilities outside of your work that requires a skills set and aptitude for responsibility.

In terms of propriety, it is considered rude to cut things that don't need to be cut, or imply your host has not properly prepared the meal (in the case of salad, for instance), while at the same time it is rude to work too hard to cut something firm that DOES need to be cut (say chicken or lightly cooked carrots).  As it is common in more formal settings to provide utensils specific to the course of the meal- I propose that dull table knives can be supplied where necessary.  Otherwise, table knives should only be presented for meals which require spreading- steak knives being the preferable utensil in terms of versatility and utility. My place settings seem vestigial and ornamental at this point.  What am I missing here?  Why do I find myself cutting easily cut items with a fork rather going through the hassle of switching hands and cutting one piece of food at a time with a dull knife?

Any time I questioned things, I was called a racist and a bigot. Even though for most of my life I considered my views liberal, the election cycled saw me switching to the Trump Train.  Specifically on the recent immigration issue, while I don't think it will particularly stop terrorism or that terrorism is a threat currently, I do think it shows Trump's commitment to preventing a situation like the one in Europe. The initial green card situation was unfortunate, but from what I have seen was quickly solved. In addition, I see no reason why non-citizens, regardless of what they've gone through, should feel entitled to enter the US. Yes, it would be nice to help people, but realistically the world is filled with people who are suffering, even in our own country, and we should be smart with who and how we help.   I hold a similar view on something like the wall. I don't think it will even close to eliminate illegal immigration, and it won't even stop the main source of illegal immigration. However, it will stop some illegal immigration, and from what I've seen the cost is relatively minimal.  In terms of bringing jobs back, I think its a simple concept that if things can be done cheaper outside the US without any downside, they will be done elsewhere. I don't know how successful Trump will be, but I believe free trade deals will only hurt the average american worker.   As for diplomacy, given the US's economic and military power, I don't see how Trump can hurt US relations. Dictators and horrible regimes across the globe are worked with because of the resources they have, and from a purely statistical standpoint I don't think the US can be ignored. I have no doubts some in the international community will hate Trump, but others will like him, and regardless the US has enough leverage that they will be worked with. I also don't believe Trump will start any major wars. He is highly successful and even his greatest detractors admit he cares about himself, so especially after he has stated he is anti-war, I do not see him getting into a situation where he puts himself at risk.  Finally, in terms of his provocative actions/statements, I generally don't have an issue with him. I am a quite un-PC person, and on top of that I have seen many of his actions/statements twisted brutally out of proportion.

You already probably get a lot of flak for simply expressing your views, and I'm sorry if you've heard all of this before. Many others can and have offered more economic based analysis, but I simply want to offer my personal perspective of why I feel uneasy about Trump and his presidency.  I don't think that everything about Trump is bad, and I do believe that many times he is justified in his defense of himself, but to me, it is his own love for himself above all that makes me afraid. He is oftentimes unwilling to see the validity in any perspective other than his own, which is an essential part of not only being a good representative, but also a good leader.   Kellyanne Conway's statements at Meet the Press are incredibly troubling. Alternative facts? There can be alternate analyses. There can be logical refutations (the pictures of the crowds are at different times, etc.). But there cannot be two different sets of facts. She did not even attempt to reconcile the two perspectives or offer a reason why they were right and the news was incorrect. This isn't even something that matters. I sure as hell don't care how big the crowd is. But if his administration is willing to lie right from the get go, when the stakes don't even matter, I have full faith that they will have no qualms lying to the American people when they believe they're doing it \"for a greater good.\"   His statements using his own ad hominem attacks against those who disagree with him sends to me the message that he is willing to say anything in order to \"win.\" In response to criticisms from the family of a fallen soldier saying that Trump had made no sacrifices for his country, he refuted it with what he felt were his sacrifices but he added on, \"If you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably \u2014 maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say. You tell me.\" It's horrifying what countries like Saudi Arabia, etc. are doing in the terms of women's rights in the name of Islam, but this was simply a tactic to distract from the points. He made these allegations that had (1) nothing to do with their statements against him (2) had no proof and (3) used their religion and ethnicities as arguments against them. This is scary to me. Obviously, he should be able to defend himself from statements he believes misrepresents him regardless of who they were made by, but the disregard for our service members simply based in religion and ethnicity in order to invalidate criticisms speaks volumes to me, especially since that was his knee-jerk reaction to the question. If he is willing to throw the dignities and reputation of an American military family under the bus to protect himself, what else will he sacrifice? You might dismiss this as anecdotal, and it's not particularly analysis based, but it is important how he treats people who don't agree with him.   If he cannot treat those that disagree with him with respect, then what happens when there comes a time that he may disagree with the American public?   Trump does not represent me. He does not represent many people. That would be fine, but he does not listen to the concerns of those who do not support him. He lashes out at criticism. This will hinder him from representing the American people effectively, especially if the interests of the country and his own eventually unalign.  Just because it's in both Trump's and the American people's best interest to not start a war doesn't mean all of our interests will align. You seem to be unconcerned and even submit it as a benefit that Trump is unwilling to put himself at risk. To me, a president *must* be able to put himself at risk to help the American people. His actions do not give me faith that he would choose the America over himself, especially if he thought he could get away with it.  I thank you again, and would love to be proved wrong as well.

Here's some advice, though I don't think any of this will make Spinoza entirely clear.  1. Read the book once before re-reading from the beginning.  You'll then be in a position to understand what work he wants the earlier sections to do for him, and how the conclusions he reaches there get more fully fleshed out in the course of the treatise.  2. Try reading some of the work he is responding to and developing on.  He very clearly sees himself working in the Cartesian tradition, for example, so try reading some of Descartes' work (beyond just the *Meditations*, if possible) for background, since it tends to be much more accessible than the *Ethics*.  You also might consider looking at some of Spinoza's earlier work: the *Principles of Cartesian Philosophy*, the *Short Treatise on God, Man, and His Wellbeing*, and the *Emendation of the Intellect*, all of which I, at least, found less opaque and which contain some of the seeds that would see their mature development later on in the Ethics itself.  3. Check out some secondary sources.  I'm not an expert here, but I remember thinking Della Rocca's *Spinoza* being a pretty good introductory text, and I really enjoyed Bennett's *A Study of Spinoza's Ethics*, though I should forewarn that the second of those is harshly opinionated and critical of Spinoza at points, and I'd warn against introducing yourself to a philosopher by way of someone unsympathetic to them.  4. Try reading it with a (dedicated and intelligent) friend and getting together to discuss it every now and again.  When I was in undergrad I helped run a book club partially devoted to the *Ethics*, which I found very helpful for understanding some of the more confusing passages.  Anyway, the *Ethics* is an amazing bit of philosophy, and, despite its intimidating facade, I think you'll find it really rewarding if you're willing to put in the requisite mental effort.

These claims are the subject of an investigation by National Geographic and Fox ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/neil-degrasse-tyson-investigated-by-fox-natgeo-networks/2018/11/30/ab38382a-f520-11e8-99c2-cfca6fcf610c_story.html ) NdT has responded.

Looking at the talk page, ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neil_deGrasse_Tyson ) you will see an argument about the appropriateness of including these claims. (I did not participate in that discussion.) A lot of the argument is phrased in wikipedia jargon which I am not fluent in, but something about reliable sources and rules regarding the biographies of living persons seem at issue.  So, I'm not an expert on Wikipedia rules, but my lay person's understanding of them is that if a fact is significant-enough and reliable sources for it are provided, it should be included. The significance seems obvious. NdT himself felt the need to write a long response. Which he presumably would not have if it was not significant. His employers (or maybe he just contracts with NatGeo and Fox) have felt the need to start an investigation. The reliability of the sources (WaPo mostly) is not really in question.  So I'm forced to conclude that Wikipedia should mention on NdT's article that 1. He was accused of sexual misconduct. 2. He responded to those accusations. 3. He is being investigated.

{"post_id": "p5hf32", "domain": "changemyview_validation", "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "history": "CMV: New nuclear reactors are not going to form a significant portion of US energy decarbonization between now and the mid-late 2030s. Because this is a topic with a lot of really fervent advocates whose attention I'm likely to draw, let me clarify some things about what I'm not saying:  1. I am espousing a PREDICTIVE view, not a normative view. I am not arguing whether nuclear power is good or bad, necessary or unnecessary.  2. I am not talking about existing reactors that face retirement. That's an interesting topic but outside this scope.  3. I'm not talking about the politics or economics of nuclear power in other countries. Again, interesting but not relevant.  The critical timeframe for US grid decarbonization is the next 10-15 years. That's roughly the timeframe the Biden administration is talking about to hit emissions targets of ~50% below 2005 levels. To be a part of a decarbonization strategy that fits within this timeframe, nuclear power will have to overcome a number of key economic and political obstacles:  It's slow. Any low-carbon energy generation is only as useful as the fossil-fuel generation it enables us to take off the grid. For any source, this means that it's only useful once it's finished and begins pumping megawatts onto the grid. In the case of nuclear, if we're to judge by previous examples--especially in the US--that's a very long time. The newest reactor in the US that I'm aware of, Watts Bar 2, took more than 30 years between construction beginning and the reactor actually going online. Even a global median has tended to be in the 5-10 year construction range. Part of this is because:  The US has a very NIMBY-friendly planning and construction process. We don't have to like it, but we have to acknowledge it. We've made it very easy for people to halt construction on a whole host of processes due to a whole range of concerns. For nuclear power to move forward with new construction, the industry will have to figure out a way to either convince NIMBYs or directly oppose and overcome them. This is not an obstacle unique to nuclear power (as NIMBYs have successfully opposed wind and solar projects) but it is still one that the nuclear power industry cannot pretend is nonexistent.   Additionally, it's a very difficult technology to work with, and a great deal of its current workforce is nearing retirement age without a real path forward to replacement, or even expansion, of that workforce.  Lastly, nuclear is expensive. Last year's Lazard LCOE analysis suggests that nuclear has a levelized cost of energy range of 118-192 $ /MWh for nuclear power, while wind is $28-54 and utility-scale solar is $32-44. There's just not a good reason for financiers to fund new nuclear plants. If people want to argue that federal subsidies or investment could flip this picture, I'd ask that they make the case for those subsidies/investments to actually come into being. As a point of comparison, the federal government *could* fund a national-scale high speed rail network too, but the fact is that it isn't and likely won't in the immediate future.

The rebels could bomb it due to the defense forces (including Death Star 2) so they had to do a land strike.   Basically it easier to send in strike teams rather then rebuild after destroying everything.", "human_ref_B": "Theatre shields are the main reason why ground combat is still a major part of Star Wars warfare  Ground based planetary shields can be much stronger than space borne shields, because they don\u2019t need to be moved around with thrusters or hyperdrive, they can take up much more space than what\u2019s possible on a starship, and they can take advantage of an entire planetary mass for inertial dampening, heat sinks and cooling  These factors mean that ground based cannons can generally out shoot space borne ones. In an extended slugging match between a shielded ground base with ground to space cannons and a fleet of starships, the relatively cheap ground base would be able to take down lots of expensive starships before its shields fail and the cannons are destroyed  Long range bombardment of the bases doesn\u2019t work either, because Star Wars turbo laser weaponry seems to have a limited range, probably no more than a couple thousand kilometres or so. Presumably, the planetary and theatre shields are also strong enough to withstand nuclear and kinetic strikes from mass drivers and asteroids  Blockade running also seems to be pretty easy in the Star Wars universe, given the limited range of weapons, the strength of shields, and powerful signal jammers limiting the utility of automated long range weaponry and point defence. So simply laying siege to a planet by preventing anything from leaving or entering orbit is difficult and expensive - we can see this in the Trade Federation\u2019s blockade of Naboo, and the Empire\u2019s failed attempts at preventing the Rebel Fleet from escaping Hoth  And simply strategically bypassing planets is a dangerous proposition too, because fleets and starfighter squadrons can conduct lightning raids on vulnerable supply lines and the like, potentially crippling the larger campaign  However, theatre shields and planetary shields are vulnerable to ground assault, because they can\u2019t stop vehicles and infantry from entering the perimeter. Powerful electrostatic effects destroy air vehicles and projectiles, preventing them from flying straight in. So the only solution is to land just outside the field and enter using walkers and infantry (repulsor based vehicles apparently perform poorly at the edge of powerful shields)  Once inside the theatre shield, the attacking forces can either engage in a long range artillery duel to destroy the shield projectors (something that can apparently take months, and result in significant attrition)  Or they can just power through with a swift frontal assault, engaging enemy defences at close range with as many troops and vehicles as they can at once. This results in the Napoleonic style combat you describe, where it seems like everybody has their troops concentrated onto a small battlefield, blasting away at each other with everything they\u2019ve got.  The modern warfare paradigm of long range precision strikes just doesn\u2019t work with Star Wars technology because of theatre shields and powernya point defence.  One way to circumvent all this is to have small commando teams and saboteurs disable the theatre shields and planetary defence cannons from within, allowing orbiting capital ships to close in and bomb the crap out of everything from space   Another way is to design ships purpose built to engage in orbital bombardment like Star Destroyers, allowing them to overpower smaller bases through sheer brute force without the need for ground invasions or commando sabotage. Note that this doesn\u2019t work for better equipped bases like Hoth, which have ion cannons and strong shields   Thus far, the most effective method of defeating planetary defences is to simply build a turbo laser powerful enough to punch straight through any shield, no matter how powerful. But you\u2019d need an enormous weapons platform to support such a weapon, and a turbo laser that powerful would also have the unfortunate side effect of completely destroying the planet behind the shield.   The military theory behind such a weapon (\u201cDeath Stars\u201d) is that no planet would dare resist such a weapon. In a \u201cnormal\u201d invasion, planetary defenders can tell themselves that they can wear down their opponents with guerrilla warfare, airtight defences and attrition, and hope to outlast their opponents as they run out of supplies or political will, or buy enough time for a friendly fleet to arrive and force the invaders to retreat  However, with a Death Star, there\u2019s simply no hope of bogging down an invader in a costly ground invasion. They can shoot straight through your shields and blow up the planet as soon as the Death Stars come within range - which means the war is practically lost the moment they lose too much ground in the space battle.   The whole point of the Death Stars and Star Destroyers was for the Empire to avoid having to fight those old fashioned Napoleonic style battles. As strong as the Empire was, they couldn\u2019t hope to win in a \u201cregular\u201d war in which every disloyal planet put up planetary shields and cannons and shoved blasters into the hands of their entire population.   The Death Star ended up being more trouble than they were worth, because of how hideously expensive they were, and because basing one\u2019s entire military strategy on a single vulnerable target was a disaster waiting to happen.   If they had spent that money on recruiting more stormtroopers, building more Star Destroyers and paying for more spies/blackmail/bribes etc. They might have been able to win the protracted Napoleonic style ground wars that would have resulted from the dissolution of the Senate", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 6183.0, "score_ratio": 5.3333333333}

The two most commonly cited reasons for the existence of the electoral college are 1) to serve as a buffer between the popular vote and the presidency, and 2) to allocate additional political power to smaller states. I believe that the way the electoral college is currently organized doesn't effectively accomplish either goal. For the goal of serving as a buffer, most states legally mandate that their electors vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote. Some electors can (and have) violated faithless elector laws and faced a variety of legal consequences for it, but those cases are few and far between. But the process of having electors at all diminishes the second goal of allocating extra electoral power to small states. Smaller states have more electoral votes per capita than larger ones, but fewer total electoral votes individually when compared to larger states. The power of their \"extra\" electoral votes lies in concentrating those votes, which is undermined by having electors that can behave faithlessly. If one California elector is faithless, the voting power of California as a bloc is diminished by less than 2%. If one Wyoming elector is faithless, Wyoming's voting power is diminished by a third.   The crux of my view is that I believe that we ought to choose one mission for the electoral college, and set it up to succeed at that mission, or else do away with it entirely. If the mission of the electoral college is to provide a buffer to the popular vote, then we ought to do away with faithless elector laws and winner-take-all electoral voting. If a third of people in Wyoming vote for a Democratic candidate, then one of their electors should be chosen by state Democratic leaders; if two percent of Californians vote for a Libertarian, the Libertarians should get to choose one elector. And if these electors are absolutely free to vote their conscience, they can adequately serve as a buffer to an irresponsible popular vote. Alternatively, if the goal is to give small states extra electoral power, we should do away with the \"college\" element entirely. States should pass laws governing what happens to their apportioned electoral votes without any need to appoint electors or convene them to have a vote. If Wyoming is winner-take all, then a candidate with 51% of the vote their simply gets 3 electoral votes: no electors, and no chance for faithless electors.   Why, given these options, should the electoral college remain in its current state?

But giving the minority inherent control based on being more spread out isn't fair either.   The electoral college helps mitigate this problem by lumping the urban and rural areas together as one unit, but with the influential potency of everyone combined. This allows each state to gauge its population's needs and fight for their own majority. If a state has roughly equal proportions of urban and rural populations, then it will bounce back and forth  between red and blue.   Overall, this gives the country a balance of political power between the rich and the poor, the educated and uneducated, the religious and non-religious.

Why should we believe what science says? How can a belief ever be justified? What is logic? Does logic give us knowledge of the world? What are the fundamental constituents of reality? What does it mean for something to be 'true'?\" So, let's just take the first question in the above list: is knowledge possible? And here we might note there is some disagreement in the field of philosophy. Fine. But, well, if there is disagreement here, and if this disagreement seems rather troubling, then it seems you should probably also be troubled regarding the claim we said science makes about the age of the earth. Or, to put it differently, whatever issue you are having with the disagreement in philosophy should, we might say, translate into a corresponding issue with claims in science. If we find disagreement regarding whether or not knowledge is possible, doesn't that affect exactly how \"settled\" knowledge claims regarding the age of the Earth are?   So, whatever uncertainty there is in philosophy will filter to scientific matters, insofar as scientific matters presuppose answers to philosophical issues. Maybe we aren't all that bothered by that. I know I don't lose sleep over the age of the earth. And so, if we aren't all that troubled by the resulting uncertainty in the issues that depend on philosophical positions, then maybe we need not be troubled by whatever uncertainty there is in the philosophical positions themselves, and moreover, we certainly don't have to plumb for a sort of general relativism because of any of this.  More generally, I think a lot of people, when they first encounter philosophy, aren't really sure what to make of philosophical claims. For most of their education, and life generally, they are used to taking claims mainly based on authority. So, the textbook says something, or the teacher says something, or your parents say something, or your priest says something, and that's that. You might ask some internal questions about what they say, but rarely are you going to raise your hand in a physics class and ask \"but, really, what is 'knowledge'?\" Almost nobody actually conducts the scientific experiments, or understands the complex mathematical proofs, or pored over dense historical documents to piece together some historical claim or really done the heavy-lifting that is sort of real work to be justified in making claims in science, math, history, or really anything.  So, people come in to philosophy, and they are thrown. It's one of the first time people are being asked to think for themselves and really inquire about the foundations of thought. You are being asked to evaluate an argument, defend claims, make cogent objections, and articulate reasonable positions. And without being able to rely on authority, a lot of people get lost and confused. Not seeing a clear answer, they then say, \"well, I guess it's just all opinion.\" And this is, in some sense, an intellectually cowardly answer. It's often a sort of thought that goes \"well, if there is no one to tell me what the answer is, then there must not be an answer.\"   As to \"answers\" or \"solved questions\" in philosophy: in a certain sense, there are lots of answers philosophy provides all the time. Like, there are fairly clear answers to things like \"what is S5 logic?\" or \"what does Hobbes mean by \"state of nature\"? or \"what's Gettier's argument that knowledge is not justified, true, belief?\" or \"What's the argument for the pessimistic meta-induction?\" And like, if you tell me the argument for the pessimistic meta-induction is that \"cupcakes are tasty,\" I'm confident in saying your position here is wrong and this is a solved question. In general, this is a lot of what goes on: 1) someone has a naive philosophical view, 2) they take a class or read about the view, and 3) they get a more sophisticated version of the view. And, we could even say, philosophy as a field, takes it that those naive views (that students often start with) have been refuted. But usually when people ask something like \"does philosophy provide answers?\" they don't mean things like this. Instead, they mean to ask something like \"does philosophy provide an answer to if there is free will, or if morality is objective,\" or other super-general big questions. And we can say that there isn't a consensus in the field for these big questions. But does philosophy provide an answer to these questions? I mean, we definitely have people providing arguments for positions, and defending those positions, and espousing those positions. But if you want someone to just tell you the answer to the big philosophical questions, then I worry you may be misunderstanding what a lot of philosophy is, and, some of the goods that come from studying philosophy.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 12738.0, "score_ratio": 1.1428571429}

{"post_id": "9vid3v", "domain": "legaladvice_validation", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "history": "My son is a middle school student and I was told by school officials that he was removed from his math teacher's classroom because they felt that she was \"out to get him\" by unfairly giving him a failing grade. My son is a public middle school student in VA who's always gotten A's and B's. However this first quarter in Math (algebra) he received an F. He's always done well in math before.  I was unaware of this grade until I got a call from his school guidance counselor informing me that he was removed from this teacher's classroom because it was their belief that this teacher was, and I quote, \"out to get him.\"  Apparently there's issues with how this teacher is grading his work and also something about the time she's taking in her grading. As many of you may remember, in middle school algebra it was always important to show your work and what you did on each side of the equal sign. It seems this teacher was applying very strict standards to him. If he failed to show one aspect of how he solved the problem, he got a zero on it. Even if the answer was correct. If I remember from back in my day, it was never like that when I was in middle school. You got points deducted, but never a zero.  Judging by how swiftly he was removed from the classroom, I'm guessing these high standards weren't applied to everyone.  This issue came to attention because my son, having yet received another F on a test, asked to speak to a teacher who is there to help students on IEPs. I should add that IEP stands for Individualized Educational Program. It's basically special education for his ADHD that allows him to get more individual attention from other teachers. This teacher immediately took issue with what she saw and contacted the school guidance counselor.   I have a meeting next week with the principal to discuss the issue in more detail. My question is what are reasonable demands to rectify this situation and do I have any rights to demand anything?   I was literally told by a school official that they thought this adult was \"out to get\" my child. Should I demand she be fired or moved to another school? How can she be trusted not to do this to another student?  How can I trust her in the same building as my son? What if he were to find himself somewhere alone with her. If she's willing to unfairly ruin his academic record then how far is she willing to take it? Should I consider her presence to be a liability to him?   What are my rights concerning having his grade changed? He got an F from someone they felt were so biased they immediately had him removed from her classroom. There's no way this grade should be allowed to stand, right?  I want to reiterate that this isn't a case of some helicopter parent being upset at a strict teacher. This all occurred before I was ever made aware of the situation. Other school officials came to a conclusion that he was being unfairly treated and removed him from her class before I ever received a phone call. I'm also upset because I reach out to every teacher at the beginning of the school year and ask that if there are any issues to please contact me so i felt I should have been made aware of the failing grade before the quarter was over. I also met with a couple of his teachers several weeks ago as part of his IEP. This teacher did not show up. I then assumed everything was ok since he was doing fine everywhere else.  I actually recorded the phone conversation where they said they felt like this teacher was out to get him.

An old-school teaching method was to hold high potential kids \u201cmore accountable\u201d than others. In other words, each kid isn\u2019t graded against each other, they\u2019re graded against themselves. It was more often done in more subjective classes like English than maths, where there\u2019s more leeway.    I understand the teacher\u2019s perspective here, as a kid who used to do everything in his head. If you don\u2019t write out the steps you use and get the question wrong, the teacher can\u2019t see where you went wrong to help you fix it in the future. Since math builds on itself, training yourself to write it out is important. But it sounds like he\u2019s been pulled from the class and is going to get individualized education on the subject.    You should have a meeting with the principle and the teacher about this, but it sounds like the school knows there is an issue with this teacher and is working to remedy it.

The people present in the meeting should at the least be:  * Yourself and some support (significant other, your parent, whatever is applicable - for emotional support, someone to have your back so you're not alone, someone to catch something you might overlook given the stressful situation, etc.) * Guidance counselor * IEP Teacher * Principal * Potential future algebra teacher  You guys may be able to hammer out an amicable solution. Having multiple representatives from different fields helps keep accountability (as opposed to a meeting with just you, the principal and the garbage teacher, for example).  As for the teacher. You have potential unions and contracts and tenure working against you. And principals and school districts that want to avoid lawsuits/bad publicity. Like I said, I'm not a lawyer but if you want to go this route, be prepared to dig in. However, you should definitely ask the principal what will be done with this teacher, or what will change in the system to ensure this won't happen again. Perhaps this answer will shape how you feel about going forward.   Edit:  Curriculum have changed since our day. Like you mentioned, partial credit should be applied when appropriate. If the garbage teacher or principal try to defend the 0s, don't hesitate to mention that you were told by school faculty that this teacher was \"Out to get\" your son, which is not part of any curriculum.

{"post_id": "9x6enr", "domain": "legaladvice_validation", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "history": "Son has a peanut allergy, school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts. This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school, where he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life threatening.  We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in a snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.  So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another students snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hard head and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him.   We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.  Once again the story is \"he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him\". Okay so a 6 year old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him.   Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a \"Do not worry! This won't happen again\". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.  Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and say that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back \"if he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers not parents.\"  We have no issues for a while until this week. Some parent brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought \"it was only in the crackers\". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter one's. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.  We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them.

Bats comprise about 20% of the species diversity of mammals and are the only flying mammal. That last point is really what makes them and their physiology quite unique.  People often ask why so many deadly diseases come from bats. It's largely down to their unique immune system. Flights muscles tend to undergo a ton of wear and tear through just basic use so the bat inflammatory system has to be toned down quite a bit or else the constant tissue damage would just lead to deadly inflammation. With this relatively toned down inflammatory response, bats' antiviral immunity is basically always on. Ours only kicks into high gear when our immune system gets the infection signal.  So when we get a bat disease spillover into humans, the virus that has evolved in the presence of a relatively quiet inflammatory response but heightened antiviral wreaks total havoc in a relatively slow antiviral system and significantly higher inflammatory response thus we get hemorrhagic fevers.  Immune systems are general are shaped by evolution in a niche environment. Europeans and Africans have quite different intra-species immunity and similarly for inter-species immunity macaques and chimps have basically the same immune system but it's better tailored for their environment. Say an overall better immunity towards a disease like HIV versus humans.

Let me start by saying that I have never gone out of my way to be unkind to those who do not identify with their birth sex and that I would refer to  the individual as they would like within reason. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that I believe that society should encourage those who \u201cfeel\u201d like the other sex to transition hormonally or through surgery. From my point of view, gender seems to be associated with certain expressions of the appearance, such as clothes, makeup, and demeanor. Therefore people who don\u2019t \u201cfeel like a man or a woman\u201d need to redefine themselves in order to be able to act and dress how they like. But why is it not possible to simply dress and act the way you like ? Why does one need to create new labels that only narrow our current definitions of \u201cman\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d by implicitly saying that my personality cannot exist in side of a man\u2019s body.

These questions seem impossible to answer, which only makes the prospect of mutilation of their natural genitalia even more disturbing. Shouldn\u2019t the proper way of achieving your desired identity be to open the boundaries of current ideas of how each sex expresses themselves?

My answer will only sort of explain this and I'm going to have to zoom out a little bit to get to discuss some big picture questions in economics.  Up until the 1980s, economists' considered long run technological change to be a sort of black box that couldn't really explained. During the 1980s , Paul Romer developed endogenous growth theory. I don't want to get too deep into how the model works, but the core idea is that growth is determined by spillover effects of human capital. That is to say, lets say I become an expert computer programmer. These skills will help me make a lot of money. But I won't be able to monetize all the work I do. I might inspire someone to build off my products, or someone might borrow my code to make something better. So, the level of growth is determined by how much human capital there is, and the ability for that information to spread. (There are reasons actual economists will quibble with bits of what I said, but beyond the scope of this subreddit)  This brings me to some really interesting research done by Sociologist AnnaLee Saxenian. Saxenian compared the Route 128 region around Boston, to Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley has become the center of the global tech industry, while Boston remains a relatively minor player. Saxenian argues that while Boston and Silicon Valley saw a massive concentration of human capital, all the brilliant ideas tended to be concentrated within individual companies, whereas good ideas could spread like wildfire in Silicon Valley.  She argues that differences between Silicon Valley and Route 128 lies in the different cultures. Route 128 companies tended to have a very formal, buttoned up culture. Management worked in a highly hierarchical manner. Workers were discouraged from interacting too much with people in other companies out of fear trade secrets would leak out. Companies hired lots of \"bean counters\" rather than individuals willing taking a lot of risks. The entrepreneurial culture in Silicon valley was very different, and much less formal, hierarchical, and conservative. They high level of constant informal interaction of firms in Silicon Valley created massive knowledge spillovers that helped transform it into the central node of the global technology economy.  So this brings us to your actual question. Saxenian looks at two major companies Sun (which for a while was one of the most important tech companies, and developed some technologies like Java and MySQL that are everywhere) and Apollo, which no one remembers anymore. As Apollo started to grow by leaps and bounds, they decided to bring in a \"grown up\" CEO who cut his teeth in the very traditional General Electric Corporation. He enforced a strict dress code, and strongly discouraged beards and moustaches. He was hardly alone, and lots of east coast tech startups became much more formal whereas, with suit jackets and ties. IBM is unique. It's not located in a hub, but in a closed off suburban HQ outside NYC. While IBM long had a near monopoly on the tech sector, it saw this sort of informal mingling that drove Silicon Valley as a threat of having it's best ideas and researchers stolen. I think the emphasis on formal dress can be seen as part of a very conservative culture that existed on a spectrum. IBM demanded wingtips and dark suits. Boston companies like Apollo any suit, and maybe cut out the scruffy beard. Sun threw monthly beer parties, and had guys dress up in Gorilla suits at parties.

Foucault has something more specific in mind than that. Star Wars fans have a particular way of talking, thinking and writing about Star Wars but that is not really a discourse in Foucauldian terms.  A discourse is a particular way of talking, writing and thinking within a particular institutional (or multi-institutional) system that both reflects and directs the particular forms of power associated with that institution. So, for example, the particular way that prison guards, judges, district attorneys, prisoners themselves, political leaders, designers of security systems, bureaucrats and even wider publics talk, think and write about prisons and all of the associated systems that connect to prisons (criminal codes, courts, policing, etc.)   You might at this point say, \"So what? Of course people within particular institutions have specialized professional terminologies, terms of art, and so on, and of course people in general have some model or vision of what happens in those institutions\". You could do a social history of prisons that analyzes all those documents and explains the technical jargon and yet not be thinking the way Foucault thinks about a discourse.  So it is more still just than specific ways of talking, thinking and writing within institutions. It comes back to \"reflects and directs power\". Foucault's poststructuralism descends out of a branch of linguistic and philosophical thought in which it became important to argue that there is no thought before or outside of language--that what we think is always created by and confined to language. So those particular ways of thinking and speaking within prisons (for one example) for Foucault are not evidence of or expressive of forms of power, authority or practice within prisons, they ***are*** power. They don't come after the prison is established; they establish the prison as an institution. They don't come from human beings who have a prior social existence or a prior set of political or economic interests; the discourse makes the human subjects who exist within and in relation to prisons. We don't decide to represent prisoners in some strategic way in order to establish, reform or abolish prisons; the representations make the prison and make the prisoners, they define and circumscribe what prisons do and how we are made as subjects in relationship to prisons.   This is a hard idea to grasp not so much because it is complicated but because it contradicts or contests how most of us most of the time prefer to think of ourselves as political and social subjects. When we think of wanting to talk, speak or think about a concept like the prison, we imagine ourselves to be the masterful authors of those thoughts and we imagine ourselves to have strategic or conscious aims in speaking that way. Foucault makes it hard to think of human agency in those terms, which is one reason he could often be frustratingly indirect or abstruse when he was asked what he wanted people to do about prisons or madness or sexuality etc. There is a kind of \"soft Foucauldian\" description of discourse that you can work with that doesn't fully take on board his whole critique, and that's what you often see in academic writing--an argument that particular institutions are bound to particular ways of thinking and speaking and that those terms and concepts in some sense \"rule\" those institutions and the people within them, in ways they are not entirely aware of or able to control. In the case of prisons, for example, you could look at how prisons encode certain ideas of control, punishment, isolation, etc. almost necessarily and that these ideas precede and supercede what any given leader, administrator, employee or prisoner within a prison might want to think about policies or actions they will advocate or follow. A \"soft\" theory of discourse in a Foucauldian vein might stress how much specialized ways of talking and speaking are a hard constraint on what human subjects can do in the same way that some material conditions are a hard constraint--you can't grow crops in a desert and you can't take actions within a closed system that a discourse has no way to represent, imagine or articulate.", "human_ref_B": "We trust doctors (for example) because they use a lot of fancy words, a vocabulary (discourse) that excludes us from a full understanding of what they're talking about.

Let me create a bit of a straw man here. Has anyone ever seen an exchange like this on Reddit?:  *OP \u2013 I\u2019m a 24-year-old female and I\u2019m having issues with my 38-year-old male partner focusing too much on work.* *He comes home stressed and exhausted and often doesn\u2019t have time for affection and conversation.* *When I bring up my concerns, he says that he\u2019s burning the candle at both ends and, he\u2019s doing the best he can.* *Am I being unreasonable here?*  *Redditor 1 \u2013 First of all, your bf is a total creep.* *There\u2019s a power differential here and he\u2019s gaslighting you.*   *Redditor 2 \u2013 Eeewww!* *24 and 38!* *Yuck!* *Get out of there as soon as you can!*  I think I have that about right. If anyone feels that I have mischaracterized such exchanges, please let me know.   Ok, now that we have established that, I\u2019m going to say that I find the language used by Redditors 1 and 2 to be highly problematic. Why is it OK to dismiss the validity of a relationship out of hand simply based on an immutable trait like age? It wouldn\u2019t be OK to discriminate so blatantly against someone based on race or gender. What makes age different?  I suppose I understand the concept of power differentials in theory but in practice people mature at dramatically different rates. There are people who are pretty much all grown up in their early 20s, there are people who never really get the adult thing figured out. I think we have all met people who fall into either category too. Discriminating on age seems completely arbitrary to me.   This is why we should just accept the fact that if two adults are in a consensual relationship that they find mutually fulfilling we should avoid using judgmental language. To do otherwise, is to engage in prejudice.   Also, just to get this out of the way, I personally am pansexual (check out username), I had sexual relations with many different races, genders, sizes and of ages that range from 25 years older to 18 years younger than myself. I find sex to be a very healthy and wholesome activity and I think people are way too uptight about it. So, I know of what I speak.   All right, change my view people.

If she said \"He told me to believe him because he knows better\" its definitely reason to bring up the age gap.  People feel okay judging the age gap because the context given is usually something like \"Partner B is being [insert unreasonable or manipulative behavior here] oh and btw I'm 28 he's 42 and we have a 10 year old child\"  So I think generally people don't think age gaps are inherently creepy (unless the younger person is like 18 and 1 day old). I think we see some power imbalance or manipulation and then the age difference is context that helps possibly explain the behavior. In that case, the age difference is simply a proxy to say \"there's a power imbalance here\".  You also bring up race. There are instances in relationship subs where OP will talk about not being accepted by their spouses family.

Canada is hard for non-residents to gain access to, but probably the most comfortable if you're coming from the US. It has the advantage that it's close to the US without being the US, so sometimes you can get US grants and anyway you are part of the North American network, which helps.  The UK pays horribly, but almost any place that is not the US pays worse than the US. Still, the UK is the worst on that front. They pay in prestige. Bureaucracy is said to be pretty bad.  Europe: varies by country, and maybe by field. The academic system is generally very different, though a few places are trying to do things the American way. Hiring seems to be more network-based, so as an outsider you may have difficulty getting in unless you know someone or can make a plausible case as to why you're particularly interested. Schools don't want to waste time on people unlikely to take up their offer. Pay in Europe in my field seems to be between the UK and Canada. Benefits are good, though.

It follows that in contrast to soldiers, warriors fight for personal glory. They often, but not exclusively, fight as individuals rather than as disciplined formations. To warriors, warfare is a way of life and its values dominate much of their behaviour. In contrast to Roman and modern soldiers, warriors supply their own weapons. A medieval knight is still a warrior, even if he fought disciplined, because his life continued to be dominated by values of personal and military glory.

AskHistorians is participating in a swag store pilot program for reddit, so here is your chance. #TL;DR: Click Here to Check It Out  **What's Happening**  We agreed to assist the admins in piloting a new program which would allow users to get their hands on community themed swag. We've provided AskHistorians swag as prizes for year-end awards for many years now, as well as offered swag as part of fundraising efforts for our digital conference (less than two weeks away!!), so we were in a good position to help with this endeavor, both having a fair bit of experience with designing such things and knowing that there is interest within the community for AskHistorians swag.  **Where Do I Get the Stuff?**  The trial program is being done through the site Teepublic. **CLICK HERE TO GO TO THE STOREFRONT**  **What Can I Get?**  T-shirts, stickers, mugs, totes, buttons, notebooks, and hoodies are what there is. Each is available in the five Historical Snoo designs that we are using for this project.  **Why Did You Choose Those Snoos For This?**  We have twenty different 'New' styled Snoos in our collection, not to mention over thirty in the 'old' style! But for the pilot program, we're limited to five designs. *If* the feedback on this is positive and we're happy with the results *and* the program expands and continues, we'd like to be able to offer all of the Snoos, since we know everyone has their favorites. But for now, we chose five Snoos intended to a decent variety of places and interests, although it of course pretty hard to have anything *close* to broad coverage with that number (and also, Snoopata is my favorite, so....).  If you want to learn more about the Snoos currently featured, check out the Snoographies we wrote up when debuting them!  * Emiliano Snoopata * Jane Snoosten * Frederick Snoouglass * Se\u00f1or de Snoop\u00e1n * Empress Snooditu  **So... the Money...?**  Much as we wish we could offer them as such, we can't hand them out for free. The point of sale is all handled by Teepublic, and the profits generated go through reddit. From there, the funds are made available to the mod team to distribute *specifically* in ways to support the community. We aren't the only subreddit piloting this, so I don't know how other communities intend to use those funds, but as in past years, we'd be using funds raised for prizes to send to the winners of the year end awards, send \"Thank You\" gifts to AMA and Podcast guests and fund promotion of the subreddit (We had a super cool plan in the beginning of 2019 to promote participation in AskHistorians at history conferences which.... yeah. That didn't happen. But we hope to be able to restart that in 2022! Stay tuned!)  **Hey, What About the Conference Fundrazr?**  The astute among you will remember we already have been offering swag through the 2021 Conference Fundrazr, but don't worry, these aren't in direct conflict with each other. Aside from the fact that the Fundrazr has some supercool, exclusive things you can't get here, between the turnout so far, and the sponsorship that we have secured for the Conference, we feel confident at hitting our funding goals there, so by choosing *this* swag instead of *that* swag, you aren't bleeding the conference of funding (Related: Wondering where your conference swag is? Pins are supposed to arrive this week, and then we'll start shipping!)  **OMG, I Can't Believe You Sold Out Like This!!!!**  We really do value your feedback on this as a community! The pilot runs for one month, after which our continued participation (assuming they expand the program) is entirely up in the air, and very dependent on what you, the AskHistorians community, would want to see! Based on past years when we've done fundraisers, or simply shared some of the swag we send out for awards, its been pretty clear that many folks would be interested in AskHistorians swag, so we're giving this a try.  If you think this is super cool and want us to expand it, *let us know*. If you think this is stupid as hell and we never should have participated in the first place, *let us know*. We take all of that feedback seriously, and as this is very much a project *for the community*, the response of the community - *you folks* - is super important for us in evaluating its success or failure. We'll be providing feedback to reddit at the end of this, and what you all have to say about it will be front and center is whatever we end up reporting.", "c_root_id_A": "hfnzzmn", "c_root_id_B": "hfnvpkb", "created_at_utc_A": 1633563393, "created_at_utc_B": 1633561269, "score_A": 7, "score_B": 5, "human_ref_A": "I just want a tshirt that says [this comment has been removed by a moderator of /r/AskHistorians]", "human_ref_B": "Is there a reason some categories don't have any items?

He was born premature to an inexperienced mother and was too weak to nurse. Mom rejected him, and when we arrived to take a look at him and see if we could help, he was cold to the touch and lethargic. We eventually got him to latch and nurse from a syringe with a Miracle Nipple attachment, but could not get him to feed from mom, and took him home.  Everything was going smoothly (healthy, growing, hitting milestones) until he was almost four weeks old, at which point I noticed a mucous discharge from his genital region. Initially his behavior was unchanged, but we took him to the vet anyway to check it out. They said they didn't know what it was and turned us away without answers. A few days later, he became really weak and started refusing formula, so we went back to the vet and asked for an antibiotic. He was prescribed Clavamox and we were given a tube feeding kit to help get food into him, as he would no longer eat any other way.  His appetite was gone, initially, because he was sick, I thought; but then the mucous went away within 48 hours, and he still wouldn't eat. Then I thought it was because of the antibiotic, which gave him horrible diarrhea, but his appetite didn't come back after the antibiotic course was completed--almost two months ago. In the meantime, we have continued tube feeding him as otherwise he will waste away.  We've tried poultry baby food, several brands and flavors of canned food (both pat\u00e9 and chunky, and including what I call \"kitty crack,\" the urgent care stuff cats go nuts for), several brands of dry kibble, formula, fresh chicken breast (both raw and cooked), he doesn't want any of it. We've tried letting him get really hungry in hopes that he'd eventually cave in, but he'll refuse food until he's weak and scrawny and I step in to plump him back up.  Recently we've tried using transdermal Mirataz, which we got from the vet, to stimulate appetite. In the hours immediately after an application, and assuming he's very hungry, he will eat a small amount of food voluntarily, but even under these conditions, it's not enough to survive: I'd estimate the equivalent of 1.5oz chicken breast at the most over a 24-hour period, which is only 60-something kcal.  We're at our wit's end. He shows no symptoms besides lack of appetite. We've had a stool sample tested and urinalysis done, and both came up clear. He has no respiratory issues, no diarrhea, no vomiting. He plays like a normal kitten, is energetic and affectionate. He just refuses to eat. And I refuse to give up on him while he maintains a high overall quality of life.   It's hard to continue tube feeding this baby, but the inconvenience isn't our largest concern. I am terrified there's something wrong with him that's causing this strange behavior and we just don't know what it is. I worry he's a ticking time bomb. He's been in and out of the vet's office time after time, but no one has any answers or suggestions for us. They say we're already doing all the right things, and they have never seen a case like this before.  Does anyone have any suggestions for what might be causing this? Tests that we might request going forward? We'll try anything promising; money isn't a concern here. We need a direction, because right now we're only turning up question marks.

It's for getting humans into the Empire and it's ideology, recruiting from \"boonies\" planets for rank and file canon fodder. It's cheap and it fosters unity and erodes individuality. Ironically at the high of the clone wars the actual clones have personalized their armor to represent their individualism. The Empire is working in reverse, making their soliders faceless cogs.

Guns are generally used for intimidation and killing (whether offensively or defensively). So the reason that someone could argue in favor of decriminalizing drugs and restricting access to guns without being a hypocrite in this case is that they perceive that most people who use drugs do so for pleasure and most people who *use* guns, use them for harm (justified or not). This is a generalization, but it helps to illustrate the categorical difference in intent between drugs and guns. Drugs do cause harm and people do use guns for pleasure, but the intent is usually the other way around.   **Access:**   Drugs are easy to make and grow. Really, really easy. Which is why it's so hard to control their manufacture and distribution. It's like a game of whack-a-mole with 100,000,000 moles. You bust a small time grower in his basement, someone else starts growing in his trailer to meet the neighborhood demand. It is generally cheap and easy for people with little to no education to make/grow their own drugs and distribute them. And it's far more financially attractive than working at walmart. So the argument against the war on drugs in this case is that it's basically unwinable.... There will always be too many moles to whack, because of never ending demand and cheap supply.  Guns on the other hand are made by a handful of major manufacturers. It would be a legislative piece of cake to end the majority of gun sales in the US. In a hypothetical scenario where guns were prohibited entirely, people who still had them would be *very* careful about using them or being seen with them. There would be a dramatic drop-off in casual gun owners (homeowners, and people who have handguns \"for protection\"). Of course there would be hundreds of thousands of legacy guns out there, but if you couldn't get legal ammunition could you easily use them? That would eliminate most casual gun use. So you'd be down to people that hid their guns, smuggled them in, or made their own using 3-D printers and whatnot. The people that keep and hide their guns are going to be largely a mix of die hard 2nd amendment folks, and low level criminals. The people that smuggle and make their own guns are most likely organized crime. All of those categories are mostly about defense of self/family and defense of business. You don't get offensive in those situations without drawing attention to yourself. So in theory there should be a drop in casual/accidental gun violence. Less kids finding their parents guns, less crazies buying a gun at a store and opening up on a school. If you don't already have a gun hidden away, you've got to have connections to get one... so suburban joe schmoe doesn't get to go on a spree so easily.   So while drug prohibition hasn't really prevented access to drugs because of ease of low level manufacturing and distribution to casual consumers, federal gun prohibition would effectively decimate the number of casually owned guns in America by restricting access to determined criminals, and consequently diminish casual/accidental/mass-shooting gun violence.   **Consumption:**  Drugs are consumed quickly. They're used up, daily, momentarily, they need replacement, continuously. Guns last a long time, you might only need to buy one gun in your entire life. So the incentive to be an illegal drug maker is much higher than to be an illegal gun maker. You can effectively make a living making/distributing drugs in a single trailer park. How big of an area do you think you'd need to make a living as an illegal gun manufacturer? Which comes down to the whack-a-mole scenario again. With drugs we've got a million uneducated people, easily replaced, making drugs to serve a never ending *daily* appetite. With guns you might have hundreds of comparatively skilled illegal gun makers/smugglers catering to a niche market which doesn't need replenishing nearly as often. Less manufacturers/distributors are easier to target/incarcerate. So a war on guns is far easier/cheaper to fight than a war on drugs.  **Buget** The amount of money spent trying to prevent 1,000,000 home scale manufacturers and 100,000,000 consumers from experiencing their drug of choice, and then incarcerating them when caught, is absurd.   Comparatively, telling a handful of gun manufacturers that they can't sell their guns in the US anymore wouldn't cost much. The cost of the war on guns would mostly be spent attempting to prevent smuggling (which they do already), and incarcerating people foolish enough to be caught using their loud illegal weapons. The number of people who actually *use* guns is a paltry amount compared to the amount of people who use drugs, so the cost of prohibiting guns would be a tiny fraction of the cost of fighting the war on drugs.  **Effectiveness**  If the end goal is to reduce violence and human suffering, then shifting money away from drug prohibition and towards harm reduction and education would help reduce the harm caused by drug use. The general perception at this point is that prohibition is responsible for a considerable amount of violence (guns and otherwise). So if we stopped spending hundreds of millions of dollars on drug prohibition, there would likely be less harm and violence, and more money (and taxes) to spend on education and harm reduction.   Comparatively, if we were to engage in a 'war on guns' and prohibit them entirely in the US, it seems extremely unlikely that this would result in more gun violence or gun related suffering in the long term. And it would cost a tiny fraction of the cost of the war on drugs. Sure it would cost loads to enforce in the early stages, but that would fall off once casual domestic supplies were dealt with, and the focus would be turned to organized crime.   Ultimately it would require far less law enforcement resources to enforce a gun ban vs a drug ban because there are far more people using drugs on a daily basis than there are people using guns.  **Conclusion**  It is not hypocritical to advocate gun prohibition whilst refuting drug prohibition because to enact both of those measures would likely result in a decrease of violence and benefit the greater good at less expense than the current paradigm.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 9952.0, "score_ratio": 9.5}

At this point, the lease is month-to-month, as the initial term has ended. According to the lease:  >\"At the end of the one-year initial term of this lease agreement, a month-to-month, automatically renewable tenancy is created.\"  I have notified the Landlord one month prior, as is specified in the lease:  >\"Tenant may terminate this Lease by providing Landlord with at least one (1) full month's prior written notice to vacate--to run from the first of the month to the last day of the same month.\"  However, they responded that both me and my roommate (i.e. both co-tenants) must agree to terminate the lease; otherwise, I have to continue paying rent (or at least, I'm still liable for rent, any damages, etc). My roommate refuses to agree to this until a replacement roommate can be found.  As I understand it, there is no way to just terminate \"my part\" since we are co-tenants, and instead the entire lease would need to be terminated. My roommate would then need to sign a new lease with the landlord.  Does this mean I'm legally locked into this automatically renewing lease until my roommate says I can leave? Will I be liable if I give written notice a month before and then just stop paying rent?  Note: Security deposit is not an issue at this point. However, another wrinkle to this issue is that the co-signer at the moment is my family friend (and not my roommate's), so the co-signer would be off the lease, as well, if I leave.

Dinosaurs and apex predators are terrifying to humans when we're on a level playing field with them, but our weaponry is so absurdly good that it would be very easy to kill a T-rex if you just had some guns. I mean, regular civilians in the US have personal armories powerful enough to take down a T-rex, I think that any sophisticated security detail backed with the kind of finances IGN had access to would easily be able to contain any animals that got loose.  T-rex has a powerful bite. We have armor shredding ammunition-hollow point rounds/explosive shells and LOTS of them.  Like sure, raptors can get the jump on one security guard if they're clever girls. But they're not going to do that to a hundred well trained/well armed guys. (This is also why I find the whole premise of Jurassic World stupid. Like, we would easily hunt down and kill all the dangerous dinos if they escaped to the mainland).  The only argument I can see is that it's wrong to bring these animals back and exploit them just because it's morally wrong to do that to living creatures. But we do that to cows, chickens, and pigs by the billions every year. So unless you are advocating for vegetarianism/dismantling the meat industry I don't think you're being consistent.

Even the biggest mistake Bernie Sanders made was to surrender to Hillary Clinton, rather than continue supporting his followers and promise them he can do better than her.  Ranging from the college I go to, to the internet groups I hang out with, there is always going to be someone who would say \"Bernie would have swept the floor with Trump.\" That, thanks to Bernie Sanders's natural charisma, social policies, and the large amount of threat he generates towards both parties, he could have become the biggest thing to ever come out of the United States in years. With President Sanders, we would have become a successful democratic-socialist nation that prides itself on its liberal and free culture.  So, let's say I agree.   Let's say that, yes, Sanders could have defeated Trump and nabbed enough electoral votes to overtake his opponent. No doubt, Sanders could win the popular vote, as well, with assistance from the millennial generation. This all would have happened, if Sanders was put into the same spotlight as Hillary and hailed as the evolution of President Obama's policies.

Rogan had a researcher on his show to discuss her research on transgender people and transition regret. The \"researcher\" is not representative of the academic community.

I've noticed recently there's a habit for philosophers or for people who study philosophy to talk about \"common\" or \"normal\" people, and assume that common people don't think about the world. It's often happened in philosophy classes I've been in where people will say things like, \"Most people don't think about the world; they only believe what's convenient for them and don't question their beliefs. But, it's important for all of us to pursue the truth. That is why philosophy is important, because knowing the truth is important.\"   One of my old philosophy teachers from my community college told me something like this when I was applying to university. She said, \"You know, being people who think about the world, sometimes we can feel out of place. But, going to college is good because you'll be around people who are more like yourself.\"   I've heard lots of things like that. Maybe it's just been my experience (if it hasn't been yours, let me know), but it seems there's always this idea that philosophers are somehow different from normal, everyday people, and the people on the side of philosophy are obviously superior.   There are texts I can think of too that give me this impression; for example, in *Nicomachean Ethics*, in the first book, Aristotle talks what the \"many\" believe happiness is as opposed to what  \"cultivated people\" believe it is. And, with Socrates, it doesn't seem like he had a high opinion of the masses; the allegory of the cave, for example, doesn't seem to show a high opinion of them.   I just never understood this notion; it sounds pretentious and elitist to me. Why is everyone so certain that common people don't think about the world? Why is everyone so certain that they're not part of the common people? Who are they even talking about?

The proletariat, by being subject to capitalist hegemony in every- day life, loses its ability to think and to do. The process of human for- mation becomes re-directed toward human functioning as simple machine, a state of servitude devoid of autonomous thought and activity; it becomes a machinic appendage of the will of the capitalist. This total loss of the energies of becoming \u2013 the radical foreclosing of human subjectivity into a mode of servitude \u2013 marks the negation of what Vygotsky imagined as human development, the complex move- ment toward human freedom-in-action. Lenin understood this dynamic clearly, and the need to build toward a new society devoid of proletarianization.\u201d  And this is the case throughout history that we do not have records of what the masses of people thought, demographics largely excluded from the same positions to not only leave records of what they think but have it widely shared and acknowledged.  But I do agree however the idea that working people don\u2019t think or aren\u2019t smart often comes from not associating with people outside their own common demographic and spaces long enough to know more than an \u201cimage\u201d, and often not sharing the same cultural likeness to recognize intellect not presented in the forms they have become accustom to.  It also isn\u2019t uncommon for people to see themselves as some how above the same influences of others such that the educated somehow imagine themselves more resistant to nonsense, however many intellectuals are just as propagandized through their social networks and such. Jaques Ellul arrives at such a point that the educated are the most vulnerable to horizontal propaganda. It sees others as objects of manipulation while oneself is able to reason but doesn\u2019t see that many people have good reasons for doing what they do and thinking what they do as part of their a of life. And there is some truth in that many don\u2019t have the time to reflect on some things, they have to labor on other things.  In this vein its easy for some to see themselves are investigating universal truths somehow outside a specific time and place where you can see the quality and nature of thinking in many philosophers reflecting the influences of their time.

No matter how angry you are over it, the American public already got over it/chose to go with these current senators.

Before you argue that I am saying autistic people shouldn't be in film and media, let me clarify I am not saying that. I just feel like the argument that they should or have be played by neuro-atypical individuals doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  When Smile was released by SIA a prevailing criticism I saw was that she chose an actress who did not have autism to play a role of an autistic teen.  This does not make sense for quite a few reasons  firstly by definition autism makes social interactions very difficult and understanding small social cues very challenging. An actor and the director and other actors will often have plenty of convos of their vision for how charecters interact and behave and have expectations which often can not be met. In addition mimicking behaviours and mirroring emotions is also a difficulty that autistic people deal with.  Conversely i beleive an individual with down syndrome can play a role suited for someone with down syndrome since there isn't a lot of nuance associated with the role, and also replicate the look of. a down syndrome individual wold probably be more costly than actually hiring a down syndrome actor.  For autism, there isn't really any factors that differentiate them and make it necessary for a role to be played by someone in the autistic community, the uniqueness comes from within, from behaviours and interests and style. For this reason it does not really make a lot of sense to hire an autistic actor since there is also no difference for people watching the fim or show going in with not a lot of background of the actors.

An actor can do such a respectful and honorable job, but the post-production and scene around them can make it offensive. A bad portrayal like the would be career ending, even if it's not the actor's fault.   I mean, look at the interviews with Maddie Ziegler. She had extreme anxiety for her role in the movie. She wanted the role to go to an autistic actress, but Sia had assured Maddie that she would protect her from any backlash. While most of the blame for the movie is (rightfully) going towards Sia, there is no telling what kind of damage this has done to Maddie's career from just being involved in a scandal. Maddie wanted to do the right thing, and now she is being punished for having her opinion steamrolled.   You might say that it's the fault of the \"keyboard warriors,\" but any (good) production team will also be looking at PR and optics.

All of them have advantages and disadvantages over the others. Sometimes not even about CAD. Integration with other softwares (CAM, CFD or FEA) are hugely relevant and will vary a lot according to context.  So just pick one that you can get for free and go for it. I have Solid Edge at home because that is the one I have been using the most in my current job and got used to it. The software comes with extensive integrated tutorials and there is a free student version.  I already taught some interns at work on how to use it and I always spend a couple of days following the tutorial, then procede to real world objects - no drawings, just a calliper - and finally I give them some examples of drawings we have drawn at the firm.  Everyone is different but it usually takes about 20-30h to finish the main line of tutorials and then about 20 more hours of free practice to get to the point where they can easily draw a realistic object like a pencil sharpener or a holes puncher or something like that. So at least one work week to get comfortable with the basic features.", "labels": 1, "seconds_difference": 4354.0, "score_ratio": 1.5}

I always hear this characteristic mentioned, but I've never really understood what it means.  Kitchens tend to use aluminum cookware because it's cheap and heats up fast, but home cooks don't.  So the speed at which a pan heats up is different than how much heat it can store.  Maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way, but what does it matter how much heat it can store if it's sitting on the heat source?  To me it sounds like the pan will stay hot if you remove it from the heat, which can't be right because that doesn't sound particularly useful.", "c_root_id_A": "iz7tt70", "c_root_id_B": "iz7u7w3", "created_at_utc_A": 1670380811, "created_at_utc_B": 1670380999, "score_A": 17, "score_B": 34, "human_ref_A": "Cast iron contains more mass, more metal than other cookware. This is more material, more capacity, to hold heat. It also transfers heat more slowly than other metals like aluminum.   That last bit has to do with the specific heat capacity, roughly how much heat energy must be added to a given unit of a material to raise it's temperature by one degree.   Iron and steel have a much higher (or lower forget how that works) heat capacity than aluminum, such that you have to pump far more energy into them in order to raise their temperature.   And the inverse is true, you have to take away more of that energy to lower the temperature of the iron. One of the primary ways this happens with a pan is by transferring it into food, cooking it.   Taken all together you have a pan that takes longer to heat to a given temperature, and gets there less evenly.   But *stays much hotter for longer in contact with food*. Which has direct implications for the temperature at which that heat is transferred to food.   Which is good for maintaining a given heat level in general. But the classic example is holding a very high temperature against the surface of food during searing.   As for whether this matters because there is a heat source. With metals like aluminum the pan may actually cool faster when food is added than the heat source can heat it. The food may remove more heat in a given time frame, than the stove can pump in. So for our searing example, this means the food would be searing at lower temperature.   Thing is that conduction, the direct contact with metal, of food touching a pan. Transfers energy much more quickly than the radiant heat of the burner to the pan.   And yes the pan will stay hotter longer when removed from heat. Which is actually pretty useful. It makes maintaining simmers in braised dishes simpler, and it's a lot of what makes baking in a skillet as for corn bread or things like dutch babies practical. Preheating the skillet, then dosing it with batter providing a *lot* of leavening all at once. It's also a lot of what makes a Dutch oven able to maintain consistent temperatures in the oven and under indirect heat. Among other things.", "human_ref_B": "A cast iron skillet and an aluminum skillet at 450\u00b0 are both at the same temperature... so what does it mean to say the former stores more heat?  Temperature and heat are different... Just like speed and kinetic energy are different.  Consider, a dump truck and a tiny car each going 45 mph: that are going the same speed but the dump truck has a lot more energy. If you're trying to get work out of those moving vehicles -- perhaps you need to crush something -- the dump truck at 45 mph is going to do a lot better job. It's going to be able to crush more before it slows down. Sure, it took more energy to get it up to that speed -- because it's more massive -- but then it has a lot more energy to give back.  Cast iron is more \"thermally massive\" than most other metals of comparable thickness.  You can get more cooking done with it (closer to the temperature you heated it to) than with other materials.  Now if I strapped eight tiny cars together, those might have as much crushing power as the dump truck.  Similarly, if I took an aluminum pan and made it several times thicker, I would eventually be able to get the same cooking performance as my cast iron pan (at normal thickness).", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 188.0, "score_ratio": 2.0}

This is actually a CMV Request...I wasn't sure I could put that in the title but I'm truly looking forward to any responses.   First off, I completely understand that the damage of racism has already been done and we have a long way to go before we're even better at it. Though we've come a long way, I'm sure even to a tiny extent centuries from now, racism will still exist.   I also understand there are situations where knowing the race of the applicant is necessary (at least I think so, do correct me if I'm wrong). Such as in medicine when applying as a new patient, where the medical statistics behind your race could help identity certain health issues since, as far as I'm aware, certain races go through certain things to a more serious degree than others. Or if there was some group or organization looking to only have a certain racial group in their midst (though that should be made clear prior so only qualified individuals apply in the first place.   Anyways! My view is that things such as Affirmative Action would not need to be in place, and that hearts on racism could further be opened up, if we just deleted the box in the first place.   While it may be nice for a more than qualified black individual to receive entry into Harvard because they (the university) needed more diversity, and they are also qualified for more money in some ways just due to their race and such (when I think it should be based on their/their parents income anyway), it stills pretty racist because then the education system is acknowledging a racist fault in their acceptance programs and it leaves people like white males in a tough spot. And the value on diversity is too heavy sometimes.   Or the unfortunate circumstances where an overqualified individual for a position at a company will be denied for the average Joe because they are Indian or Mexican or whatever.   Maybe diversity wouldn't be able to be planned out as perfectly, but then so many systems in place that say \"WE ARE RACIST AND WE KNOW IT SO HERE'S A GO PASS SO YOU DON'T SUE US LATER\" wouldn't have to exist and everyone would have an equal shot at that college/job position. If everyone at that workplace turns out all Asian, it would be coincidental. If a supervisor was hired at a company, it'd be by chance they're black or Indian. If one white male is in a class of mostly Hispanics and foreigners, it just happened that way. Either way, the application should be blind when it comes to the race of their applicants, then there wouldn't be a need for a \"we do not discriminate\" notice and people in general would be more forced to recognize we are all human regardless of our skin color.   I'd love to see a future where we have spaces to interact with our own kind but it's not because of a negative racial issue, just a healthy desire to be with your own kind because I understand we all have different customs and familiarity is comforting.   Again, we've got a long way to go and I know a lot of oppressed races feel they still deserve an upper edge or reparations or whatever, but I feel this could be another place to start in times of overall equality.

For employment drug testing, most commonly a urine sample is obtained. There are different ways that the test can be performed.  The quickest and easiest test is an _enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay_ or an _EIA_ (also sometimes abbreviated as _ELISA_). These tests use antibodies to particular substances. They are neither very specific nor very sensitive. Not being specific means that a positive result is often untrue (the test can be triggered by things other than the sought-after drug). Not being sensitive means that they frequently miss the sought-after drug, so a negative test is also unreliable.  For these reasons _EIA_s are not good options for employment screening, at least not by themselves.   There are other testing methods. Probably the best for this sort of thing is _gas chromatography / mass spectroscopy_, or _GC/MS_. This uses a pair of very accurate techniques to detect the drugs in question, and can, for example, be used to see the difference between very similar drugs as well. These tests are highly sensitive and specific.  Often, these tests will be used in combination: the rapid and cheap _EIA_ is performed. If it is positive, then the slow and expensive _GC/MS_ test is performed for confirmation.

Questions about liability and worker's comp. I teach high school choir in Kentucky. We have an arrangement at my school where the FMD (Functionally and Mentally Disabled) students visit my classes to listen and sometimes sing with us. They always have student helpers with them and occasionally have adult Classroom Aids as well.   Today, out of seemingly nowhere, one of the FMD students walked up to a girl in my class and grabbed her hair and began to slam her head down (repeatedly) on the metal bars next to her seat. I was working with other students at the time so the first noise I heard that alerted me was the sound of her head hitting the bar.   I jumped up at the sound and rushed to free her from his grasp while yelling to the other students to call the office.   Once I got him to let go of her hair, he focused his rage on me. He began clawing at my face, so I tried to protect my hands, which got some pretty deep gashes. I bent my head to protect my face and hands and he grabbed my hair and slammed me to the ground. Side note, this kid is easily 200lbs and I'm a 5'4\", petite female. He continued to rip out my hair (I realized later that my scalp was bleeding) while stomping on my legs and chest. At this point, some of the students were able to get him off me and they rushed him out of the room while he continued to scratch and yell at them.  At this point I was dazed and shaken, not to mention injured (though at the time I felt nothing as the adrenaline was in full gear). I knew I couldn't leave my class unattended so I called down to the office and told them we had an incident and we needed an administrator asap.  Once everything got settled, I learned that the student who attacked me had a history of this kind of behavior and was not even cleared to leave the FMD room. He has been attending my class for WEEKS and I had no idea he had this issue. Additionally he was with two young, female students who had not been properly trained to deal with him.   I have filled out worker's comp. paperwork and student incident reports, but I'm just not really sure what my legal options are here. Does workman's comp cover my medical bills relating to this incident? My injuries aren't extensive, but my ankle sustained a pretty good kick (it's very swollen and tender) and I believe I have a bruise rib (hurts to breathe deeply).   Additionally, I want to make sure there's no liability on my end for any of the students involved. I acted in accordance with my districts policies, but I'm worried that parents of the students who were attacked (4 total) will be angry about the fact that I didn't stop the altercation before it occurred.   Finally, what liability is the school facing in this situation? I have no desire to sue (I'm not tenured), but if I were a parent, I would be furious that this student was put in a situation that could result in such an attack.   TL;DR I was attacked by an autistic student while defending another student. I did not fight back and was injured and the situation was pretty traumatic for all involved. What are my legal options?

After leaving I called that store and spoke with the manager and asked what their policy was for returning a lost card to a customer. He goes through the usual mumbo jumbo about how they make sure to put the card in a secure location and that when the customer comes to retrieve the card they make sure to validate that the card belongs to the customer via ID. When I asked why they gave my card to a complete and total stranger they had no words. I\u2019m waiting for the official store manager to arrive so I can speak to them. I\u2019m already working with the police as to the person that has my card, but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any legal action I can take against Lowe\u2019s.

So I work at a seafood specialty store and in about a month we will be doing a 6-7 course dinner for 20 people with the theme of Japanese Italian fusion. We serve some food at the store but it's mostly poke bowls and bagels which are pretty easy to do.   The venue for the dinner is still undecided so what cooking equipment will be available is still unknown (yeah I know that's pretty bad) so we are trying to have a menu which requires as little cooking equipment as possible and as much prep as we can beforehand. Probably not going to be a fryer.   Will be a 2 person operation. Me with no professional kitchen experience but been cooking since 8 yrs old and a colleague who also has no professional kitchen exp but also passion for cooking.   For now the menu looks something like this   Courses   1) Two oysters - one salty/crisp and one sweet/creamy with rice wine vinaigrette, chopped gari and other sprinkles etc. I wanted to make a granita with some sort of fruit (perhaps grapefruit) and spiked with some Japanese booze - sake and mirin perhaps? and some sort of fragrance like cherry blossom extract or something. Too luxurious/hard to pull off?   2) Uni with spiced panko - 2 or 3 pieces of uni served on a bed of toasted panko bread crumbs spiced with that japanese spicy mix (forgot name) and other condiments. The uni should be mixed with the panko for a creamy and crunchy texture.   3) Crab meat sushi hand roll - more crowd pleaser/decadent style with American sushi influences in that the crab mix will be more decadent with cream cheese and mayo. Looking for ideas to make this more italian. Perhaps topped with shavings of hard cheese like grana.   4) Seafood cioppino with garlic ciabatta - we want to make the garlic bread a bit more japanese by infusing the garlic butter with seaweed/kelp flavour. Anyone with experience in this?   5) Grilled Argentinian red shrimp with pasta - to incorporate either miso or preserved tofu into the pasta sauce for that extra umami kick. Subtle of course. Recommendations on type of pasta?   6) A giant fruit jelly served in the middle of the table for the guests to help themselves. Need ideas for toppings/garnishes. Gelling agent probably agar or kelgo.   Other ideas which I wanted to do:   Hokkaido scallop ceviche with shiso pesto.   Seafood doria. Basically bechamel sauce with seafood over rice topped with cheese and baked.   Grilled squid bruschetta.   Some sort of decadent Amercanized maki roll with lots of toppings and sauces, but not sure how to make it Italian.    I know this is a very wide post so all sorts of comments/ideas are welcome.

We are setting ourselves up for disaster. Also, Basic Income is not a good enough solution. Hey everyone. This is my first post here so I\u2019m a bit nervous. It\u2019s pretty long but I tried to keep it organized.   Below are my views so far about automation, artificial intelligence and basic income, and where I think it will ultimately lead. BI is included because it\u2019s always the mentioned solution for the flaws with the first two. I\u2019ve been in a random debate or two about this topic in the past but was left with lots of unanswered questions. I\u2019m hoping someone can point out some new perspective and poke some holes in my negative take. Okay, here\u2019s a list of concerns.  ** Automation and Artificial Intelligence.**  1. Mass unemployment. It will start with retail and delivery/driver positions, replacing humans with kiosks and drivers with automated cars/drones. Eventually we'll have robots performing more complex jobs such as waiters, chefs, plumbing, carpentry, etc.  AI will continue to get smarter at exponential rates, it will build more complex robots than we ever could, and it will take over engineering, translators, accountants, doctors, basically every job.    2. I think the *only* jobs that will remain available will be creative/entertainment fields such as music, film, art, sports, etc.   3. Companies like Amazon are actively working to make as much money as possible with as few workers as possible. I get it, that\u2019s capitalism. But this is shortsighted, because eventually even the CEOs, IT and engineers of these pioneering companies will be unemployed when the AI becomes smart enough to develop *itself* and even start its *own* companies.   4. By pursuing this path, we are voluntarily working towards making ourselves inferior. I\u2019m not gonna get into Terminator/Matrix stuff here. But we\u2019re creating a technology that is \u201cintelligent\u201d and based on the human brain (but smarter). How can we indefinitely control an intelligent being who gains nothing by working for us?  5. I\u2019ve seen the idea that we\u2019ve already had major technological leaps that put lots of people out of work, but we always bounce back and find a way. But we have never had a form of technology which is more intelligent than us and built to be self-improving.  ---------------------------------  Now for  **Basic Income.** To be clear, I love the idea of BI\u2026 In a society where there are jobs available. But for that to be the *only* source of income seems really dangerous.  1. Who's providing the BI? Where is this money coming from? It won't be coming from taxes, because basically no one will be paying taxes, because pretty much everyone's going to be unemployed.  2. And how much is each person going to get? How is this determined? How does it stay fair and equal?   3.How are very capitalist societies going to adjust to something so polar opposite from what they\u2019re used to that it makes communism seem like Black Friday in comparison?  4. Ok, so let's say I get X amount per month. What if I need to fix my car? What if I like traveling? How does \u201cfun\u201d or basically anything outside of a strict set income figure into this? Right now even if I can\u2019t afford something I want, the *possibility* of working more hours still exists. How do I get extra money? ----------------------  Woo!

How can we indefinitely control an intelligent being who gains nothing by working for us?  If we are speculating about General Artificial Intelligence, then this is the **ONLY** meaningful question in your post.   Talking about what effect superintelligent beings on a positive feedback loop of self-improvement would have on the job market, is missing the point.   First of all, the trailblazers of general AI development have very little to do with the fields of science that produce kiosk terminals, factory robots, and utility software, that is causing most of the job market shifts. Forbidding Apple from selling a new gadget that speeds up office work, and cuts down the number of necessary office employees, won't stop the progress in programming that might eventually lead to inventing algorithms that can design better algorithms.  Second of all, you are actually **underestimating** the scope of this change.  Currently, we have a plethora of scientific theories, and engineering concepts, that we are quite confident about making some sense on paper, we just need the computing capacity to eventually build them: Space mining, Von Neumann machines, Dyson spheres, brain uploading, and so on.   Making a superintelligent being that can create even more superintelligent beings, and design machines that can produce more machines, would essentially mean **creating God**. A being that could in short order extract and transform most matter in the solar system to be used for it's purposes, while also having enough fine control over matter to fix everything that could ever go wrong with human bodies.  You are right, we can't \"control\" such a being. At best, we can hope that it was programmed right in the first place, so it will use it's power to end scarcity, create immortality, and turn our lives into utopia. At worst, it will recycle all of our bodies for spare atoms. However, it is unlikely that it would cause unemployment or poverty.. One way or another, it would be the Singularity event, the end of history.  However, if such a being is possible at all, then *it will be created* one way or another. There is no version of the future where all nations, all corporations, all individuals, and all academic circles will cease the advancement of AI programming. Trying to appeal to responsible actors not to create it, will just lead to someone more irresponsible being the first to create it.", "human_ref_B": "Others are better suited to tackle the issues you have with UBI. However, your idea of AI seems to be really out of touch with what we actually have, and as someone who is planning to go for a PhD in Computer Science, I feel qualified to debunk what you put forward.  First, I don't know why you distinguish between engineering and film in this context. If an AI could demonstrate the creative thought required to think of the social factors involving the creation of a bridge, the requirements of a budget, safety standards, local environmental conditions, then I daresay they could make a film as well. AI is already able to make art as it is much simpler.  However, the fear itself is unjustified. Currently, the most developed part of the field of AI is machine learning, which is great. However, even as developed as it is, on super computers, machine learning is still relegated to relatively simple tasks. Image recognition has an error rate of at least around 3.5% and has been stalled at that rate for over a year. Natural language processing is still young as well. Computers generally just pick out the important words in your sentence and focus on those as the main meaning. If you give computer complex sentences, they can't handle them.  These are tasks that are trivial for humans. Complex thoughts aren't even the realm of possibility. AI won't increase at an exponential rate without an exponential increase in AI research, which doesn't appear likely. The last boom was created due to the advent of deep learning, which was itself not new, but made an impact due to the higher availability of data which allowed for greater sample sizes. Moore's law is ending, so AI capability likely isn't going to increase exponentially due to an exponential increase in computational power either.  That being said, increase in computational power will inherently imply an increase in AI capability. Quantum computing could be a big deal for AI (though it is at least decades away). Stopping quantum computing would necessitate a stop in a ton of research in both physics and computing. Even fields of computing that don't seem related (theoretical computer science, programming languages) can still produce research that would aid quantum computing/AI indirectly. Even discarding the practicality of stopping research in both the public and private sphere, this wouldn't be a good idea. Considering the scope and importance of the two fields, putting a stop to this theoretical boon to AI development would necessitate nearly halting research in general. This should be something you are opposed to given that you said:  > By pursuing this path, we are voluntarily working towards making ourselves inferior. I\u2019m not gonna get into Terminator/Matrix stuff here. But we\u2019re creating a technology that is \u201cintelligent\u201d and based on the human brain (but smarter).

California   Using a throwaway because I do not want this associated with my regular account here on reddit.  Gonna try and keep this as concise as possible.  HIGHLY restrictive HOA community. This is made plainly clear upon the pending purchase of the house. We require that the prospective buyer have a quick call with one of the five HOA board members to confirm that they know just how strict our HOA is, what the $450/month HOA fee actually goes to, etc. this has been our SOP for almost 20 years.   I know this sub has a lot of hate for HOA's, but we are fair, totally transparent with all operations, and rarely have issues.

A little more backstory: He stopped paying his HOA dues back in May, he cited financial hardship. We know it is BS because over summer he purchased a $60K+ Suburban.   Since we are a gated community, we require all vehicles parked in the community to have valid and up to date registration. He put a fake license plate on the new SUV - It has no state, it says \"Society of the Sojourner\" and he has FBI anti copyright warnings on the dash of his car. So he's in violation there.

He put a comically large veggie garden on his side yard, we wrote him a letter that he needs to get rid of it, or install a fence around the side yard that also encompases his backyard (needs approval for the fence, no biggie).  Well he has now gone off the deepend, apparently we are now \"threatening his property and livelihood\" because we are not going to allow his huge garden without it being fenced in.

Being able to count slaves as 3/5s of a person when determining number of representatives and therefore number of electoral votes gave much more power to southern voters. This is not what I want to debate, but just wanted to get it out of the way.  My thoughts on the electoral college is that it gives more voice to the rural states who would likely be left out in a popular vote scheme. Yes, this means that individual voters in high population states have \"less powerful\" votes, but their state as a whole still has more power in the election than a rural state. However, the current winner-takes-all system also basically discounts the votes of those whose politics don't align with the majority of voters in a state. Instead of a winner takes all method, I believe we should go to a congressional district distribution like Maine and Nebraska use. For those unaware, in those two states, whoever gets more votes in each congressional district gets the single electoral votes from that district, and whoever wins the state overall gets the two \"senatorial\" votes.   In this system there's still a boost in importance to rural states, giving them the voice they need, but also allows for popular vote to be more in play, making it necessary for candidates to appeal to everyone in country geographically. Take California and Texas as examples. In California, conservatives often feel their vote doesn't matter because the state almost always goes blue, despite rural Cali being quite conservative. In Texas the reverse is true. In a congressional district system, candidates would have to try to win the OC and Austin, appealing to the ALL the people in these states, rather than just assuming the democratic nominee will get the 55 from Cali with no sweat, and the republican nominee the 38 from Texas.

The common thread between these articles is that in both cases, neither Sanders nor Mike O'Reilly faced any kind of retribution or questioning over their false statements because, rather conveniently, neither of them were available for comment after they occurred; Sanders called the press briefing to a close and the FCC didn't respond to a request for comment.  The fact that they weren't held accountable at all is ridiculous. A government official isn't an athlete or a salesman, they were either elected or appointed by another elected official to serve the interests of the United States and its people. They shouldn't get to run a PR campaign. They shouldn't get time to spin what they said into something else.

In my experiences, the best way to use your lemons is to use a potato peeler, keeping large pieces of peel, instead of actual zesting like you would for dessert, or using a microplane. do your best to peel without removing any white pith, as the pith is just bittering.  little bits aren't going to ruin anything though, just be cautious.   The first 40 days should be just lemon peels and high proof alcohol.  at least 100 proof vodka, but everclear works great too.  Typically I'll use 151 everclear as that is whats available to me in california.  This is definitely to remain at room temperature, to answer your question.  The second 40 days is where you strain our your lemons (which is INCREDIBLY easy when you're using peels, instead of zest), and then add a simple sugar solution usually of equal parts to your liquor solution.

To elaborate on the title,  I understand that Plato was vital to the development of philosophy, and that he has incredible historical significance.

That being said, I'm completely dumbfounded as to why people would ever, ever recommend Plato for the actual content of his writings, devoid of their historical context.  This is an exerpt from Republic, Book I, starting from 333e:  *Socrates: \"Then, my friend, justice cannot be a thing of much worth if it is useful only for things out of use and useless. But let us consider this point. Is not the man who is most skilful to strike or inflict a blow in a fight, whether as a boxer or elsewhere, also the most wary to guard against a blow?\u201d*   *Polemarchus: \u201cAssuredly.\u201d*   *Socrates: \u201cIs it not also true that he who best knows how to guard against disease is also most cunning to communicate it and escape detection?\u201d*  *Polemarchus: \u201cI think so.\u201d*   *Socrates: \u201cBut again the very same man is a good guardian of an army who is good at stealing a march upon the enemy in respect of their designs and proceedings generally.\u201d*  *Polemarchus: \u201cCertainly.\u201d*   *Socrates: \u201cOf whatsoever, then, anyone is a skilful guardian, of that he is also a skilful thief?\u201d*   *Polemarchus: \u201cIt seems so.\u201d*   *Socrates: \u201cIf then the just man is an expert in guarding money he is an expert in stealing it.\u201d*   *Polemarchus: \u201cThe argument certainly points that way.\u201d*  This point is later ended by the following dialogue:  *Socrates: So justice, according to you and Homer and Simonides, seems to be a kind of stealing, with the qualification that it is for the benefit of friends and the harm of enemies. Isn't that what you meant?\u201d*   *Polemarchus: \u201cNo, by Zeus,\u201d he replied. \u201cI no longer know what I did mean.\"*  Do I really need to point out how lazy and absurd this conclusion is? The relationship between a skill and an inverse skill just doesn't apply to moral values or personality traits\u2014\"justness\" is not a profession.

There are mechanisms of cells detecting their own malfunction or being detected by the immune system. Viral infection is such a malfunction. Usually, a process called apoptosis kicks in, where infected cells die off without inflammation of surrounding tissue. However, there are other more violent and inflammatory forms of cell death like necroptosis and necrosis. These will usually cause tissue to become inflamed, possibly rupture and be infiltrated by inflammatory immune cells to help clear the lesion.   However, such necrotic cell deaths can also be caused by an infecting virus. Basically the virus will infect a cell, use its internal machinery to replicate, and when enough replication cycles have been completed, it will rupture its host to set free the newly produced viral particles. Forcing skin cells to rupture and spread the virus can be a mechanism to infect other organisms.   The tissues a virus attacks, in this case skin, are predetermined by surface markers target cells have. A virus will usually need specific markers to recognize a target cell and enter it. Different tissues will have different marker (receptor) patterns and like that be vulnerable to different viral strains.  Edit: cluster formation is usually caused by chance. One cell is infected, replicates the virus, ruptures, and infects surrounding cells. Rinse and repeat. This way an infection spreads to surrounding tissue. Once the human scratches a lesion and touches another place on their skin, they spread their infection.

According to German Cryptologic Officer Wilhelm Flicke in a U.S. post-war report on early German intelligence successes , Abwehr enjoyed early success when hostilities initially began in France, Poland and Belgium. Flicke states that Abwehr was able to keep track of French, Polish, and Belgian troop movements. In addition, he mentions how the Germans were able to hear French and Britsh communications early in the war, giving the Germans the ability to keep an eye on British plans.  &#x200B;  According to Herman J Giske in his book *London Calling North Pole*, Abwehr also found success in operations such as Operation North Pole against the Dutch resistance and their British allies. They secretly gathered intelligence about Allied agents and were even able to capture 50 Allied operatives. They did all this and were still able to get the allies to send more support and information to the location.  &#x200B;  Abwehr also was successful in assisting the German army in the invasion of Denmark and Norway by providing target for the Luftwaffe. According to the previous U.S. report.  &#x200B;  According to Richard Basset in *Hitler's Chief Spy: The Wilhelm Canaris Betrayal* They also found success in Romania, where they were able to gain cheap oil for Germany through an extensive campaign to get the Romanian population to be scared of Soviet invasion. In order to be protected from Soviet aggression (or at least to allay the Romania people's fear of Soviet aggression), the Romanian government sold Germany oil on the cheap and pushed the Allied oil interests in the area out.  &#x200B;  After this, Germany succeeded in tricking the British once more, when they got ahold of a SOE radio operator and forced him to transmit a code Abwehr understood back to London. Dispite the operator indicating he had been compromised, the receiver did not pick up on the hints. This led to Abwehr compromising British intelligence, making Britain send agents to their deaths. This didn't last long however, as the British soon caught on, and after that the British just pretended to not know their communications were compromised and just fed the Germans false information, according to Lauren Paine in her book  *German Military Intelligence in World War II: The Abwehr*.   &#x200B;  After this, Abwehr went on a long streak of failure. Starting with grossly underestimating Soviet troop counts throughout the whole of the war, to their failure in predicting anything real about D-Day, to being completely outmatched by the many British double agents (also according to Paine).", "human_ref_B": "One of the largest coups for German intelligence early on in the war is what's known as the Venlo Incident, which involved the kidnapping of two British SOE agents across the border in the Netherlands, and the murder of their Dutch intelligence liaison.   In the years leading up to the war, a number of high profile members of the German military and civil service had travelled to Britain and revealed the existence of a number of plots to depose Hitler if and when it came to a war. During the Sudetenland Crisis, they had come within an hour of actually launching a coup attempt. These contacts with members of the opposition had not ceased after the declaration of war, including talks through the British ambassador in the Vatican. As such, it was no surprise to the British when a German refugee in the Netherlands named Fischer appeared to have contacts with Army officers who opposed Hitler. At a meeting with Captain Sigismund Best, he revealed more about these officers. Among the list of names given to the British were Generals von Rundstedt and Dorsheim, Colonel General Wiedersheim and Major Generals Geyer and Ottenstein. Also given was the name of a Colonel Teichmann, who did not actually exist. According to British documents, 'Colonel Teichmann' and Colonel von Seydlitz had a meeting with Major Richard Stevens of the SIS about potential coup attempts.  However, unknown to Captain Best, 'Fischer' was actually an SD Agent. Over the course of several meetings, which were also attended by Major Stevens, and a Dutch officer, Dirk Klop, 'Fischer' managed to convince them of the existence of a network of German officers opposed to Hitler. The lie was spun that the German generals only needed a slight push to be willing to overthrow Hitler and end the war. While the foreign office hadn't really trusted the *actual* resistance when they said they were willing to overthrow Hitler, Best and Stevens were almost completely taken in by the pretend resistance. A diplomat at the British embassy in the Netherlands said that Stevens \"was a man of immense ambition\", and \"saw in this a possibility literally of winning the war off his own bat, and this completely clouded his operational judgement\". Later meetings were also attended by Walter Schellenberg, posing as a junior army officer.   On the 8th of November, a meeting was arranged with one of the opposition Generals, to be held at the border crossing in Venlo. It's probable that Schellenberg was planning on continuing the deception for longer, but it was believed that British intelligence were behind the Beer Cellar Bomb which had been detonated a few days previously by Georg Elser. While Elser was caught trying to cross into Switzerland, German intelligence refused to believe that he had acted alone, given the sophistication of the device and plot. It was decided to kidnap Best and Stevens to assist in this regard.   For unknown reasons, the meeting was delayed until the 9th. Best, Stevens, Klop and Best's driver, Jan Lemmons, approached the border at Venlo in Best's own car. Their rendezvous was at a cafe 150 yards away from the border. Schellenberg was stood on the Cafe veranda and waved to the British officers as they approached. However, waiting on the other side of the border was an SD snatch squad. When Schellenberg waved his hat in the air, they opened fire, and bundled all four men into a car and across the border. Klop returned fire and was mortally wounded before his capture.   This significant coup for the Germans was made worse by the awful tradecraft shown by Best and Stevens. They had used a recognisable car to approach the meeting place, which they hadn't done reconnaissance on beforehand. They hadn't told anyone at the Hague station about their dealings, instead communicating only with London. This meant that they had no back-up plan in case things went wrong and also that there was no opportunity for their colleagues to come to their aid. Indeed, the British continued to broadcast valuable information about their conditions for peace and stances towards any coup attempt to the 'resistance' until the **17th of November.** Stevens was also carrying some code material and Best had a list of agent's names and addresses in his pocket. This information combined with the capture of Best and Stevens completely crippled the British intelligence network in the Netherlands and indeed damaged the entire structure in Western Europe. This also made possible the German efforts which u/thefourthmaninaboat has described.  Venlo also had the unfortunate side effect that the British became much less likely to believe the actual resistance network when they got in contact. Despite Colonel Hans Oster passing the date for the invasion of Western Europe to the Dutch military attache, the allies were reluctant to believe him after having been burned before. Incredibly valuable sources of information such as Wilhelm Canaris, the head of Military Intelligence, and Colonel Lahousen, the head of Counter-Sabotage, who were passing information through a French agent, were thus not fully exploited. This also applied to the various peace overtures made through the British embassies in Switzerland, Turkey and the Vatican.  As well as Venlo, the Germans managed one major intelligence success in North Africa. While they couldn't break British military codes, the Germans had managed to break the American diplomatic ones. The American military liason in North Africa sent incredibly valuable troop information given to him by the British over these compromised channels, which allowed the Germans to build up an accurate picture of the entire British order of battle in North Africa, incredibly valuable intelligence to have.

(sorry, this post came down with elephantiasis somewhere along the line)  First the ~~TL;DR~~ abstract - I think the point we need to drive home is that the STEM mindset and way of approaching problems is a valuable and useful tool for *anyone* in *any* field. To achieve that end, we should take lessons from the humanities, which have already successfully done so (at least, to an extent greater than STEM has).  How many people enjoy learning about history and applying its lessons? How many people graduate from college with a history major? How many of those actually do history as a career? The number drops precipitously on each question. They don't become historians and no one expects them to. It's rightly regarded as a universally useful set of knowledge.  So why is it that if someone is interested in biology, they are expected to become a research scientist? Or that if they like building things they should become an engineer? Knowing how to think in a STEM mindset is just as universally useful as a knowledge of history.  These are useful things to know and understand. We need to get away from the idea that just because you like STEM means you have to go get a career in it. It is useful to have a population educated in STEM whether or not they actually ever go into science as a career.  The problem stems from how they are taught at the introductory level. Biology is taught as rote memorization of facts. Physics is taught as whiz-bang look at what I just blew up. Math is taught as a tool to balance your checkbook. Engineering is presented as some unattainable realm of the highly intelligent, and isn't even taught to the *hoi polloi*.  But biology and physics are about the scientific method and knowing what we *are*. Math is about the fundamental language of the universe. Engineering is about how to rationally approach and solve complex problems.   When I took it, history was taught as a context, a way to learn from past failures and achievements. It was always brought out to show how things became what they are, and as full of warnings of how to avoid problems of the past. Literature was taught as a way to enter the mind of another culture, separated from you by time or space and better understand them and what they do. Art was taught as a way to express that which cannot be said, or could never be said quite as well.  We need to teach it differently. We need to show people that it's not just a collection of facts, it's a method for getting those facts, for understanding why they are what they are, and for using them to make something new.", "human_ref_B": "Like RogueEagle mentioned, it depends on the field.

I think one of the issues is that in recent years with bio/chem, is that bio-tech has been a huge growth industry, but as YoohooCthulhu  pointed out, not so much anymore. So you are still getting a lot of students who think this industry means jobs (or a good back-up if med school doesn't work), when it really doesn't.  In the \"harder\" sciences (I'm thinking of things like physics, astronomy, geosciences), graduates are finding that they actually aren't having problems finding jobs. I read an article recently that I can't find that at the moment, which shows that the in the top 10 majors with the highest employment, you have Astronomy/Astrophysics, Geology/Petroleum sciences, and some types of engineering. I also think that these fields tend to suffer from too few undergraduates because they are the types of fields (especially physics/engineering) that draw fewer students to begin with.

I'm not intending to debate Socialism vs. Capitalism, but I notice advocates of Socialism often claim that they support the idea of \"workers\" owning  various enterprises for which they work, instead of financiers.  I don't necessarily disagree in some cases,  but as I understand it, this describes something more along the lines of a 'Co-op' or a stock ownership plan.  My understanding of Socialism is that workers don't own enterprises literally.  The best someone can hope for as a worker, is that the Government acts in their interests and that some positive benefit (e.g. a profit share) accrues because of this.  I suppose that in the case of natural resources sold to foreign countries, it could make sense for the Government to charge a profit.  But these profits would be shared by the citizenry in general, not by workers specific to one enterprise or another.  And for domestic goods and services, it doesn't seem like the Government would want to earn ANY profit.  Why charge a profit margin to the collective citizenry just to turn around and give it back?  Without profits being distributed to workers, and without control over how an enterprise operates (this belongs to the Government), it seems like a stretch to say that the *workers own* the means of production.  In summary - I do think that Government ownership of industry, in some cases, can work out better for workers than private ownership, especially since it prevents a wealthy ownership class from diminishing the comparative purchasing power of workers.  But saying that \"workers\" own these industries (means of production) seems inaccurate  - especially since Government, the true owner, may become unaligned with the interests of their workers/citizens (e.g. totalitarianism etc.)  I could change my view if someone were to point out some examples where Government employees actually do participate as 'owners' in particular enterprises under Socialism, or perhaps some expanded definition of it.", "c_root_id_A": "isnmw0e", "c_root_id_B": "isno6so", "created_at_utc_A": 1666000854, "created_at_utc_B": 1666001943, "score_A": 3, "score_B": 4, "human_ref_A": "> I could change my views if someone were to point out some examples where Government employees actually do participate as \u2018owners\u2019 in particular enterprises under Socialism, or perhaps some expanded definition of it.

Anarcho-syndicalism revolves around ensuring worker self-management and cooperative industrial organization in order to phase out the wage system and perceived exploitation. You could also look into decentralized planned economies, which could theoretically eliminate some of the qualms you have with classic Marxism (which are honestly pretty valid). Any derivatives of syndicalism or cooperative economies also draw heavily from socialist labor theory to some extent but try to actively address that disconnect between the system itself and the needs of its citizens. I think that a lot of the criticisms brought up by Marxist theorists are really useful in figuring out where we\u2019re currently going wrong, but the optimal \u201csolution\u201d really depends on the sociocultural expectations and economic conditions that already influence any given country.

I\u2019ll add to what\u2019s already been said by saying that, it\u2019s important to understand there are different ways to manage a project. If your team is doing scrums, then there is a scrum master that should be managing the project in what\u2019s called an \u201cAgile framework\u201d. This is one way to define what a project is, how to break out the different work items. And they also usually work with other project managers, or product managers/owners (this is another role in agile projects with a specific knowledge on the platform, tool, or interface that\u2019s being used) and supports the higher up leaders in defining what work will be completed in each sprint. Sprints are defined as generally being between 2-4 weeks long. And they help create the structure for short \u201cbursts of work\u201d as another commenter said. This basically takes a complex concept and helps break that down into smaller, less complex, more manageable and well documented work items, generally referred to as \u201cUser Stories\u201d that basically define a single thing an employee of a business, or a customer of that business needs to do during their day. As in, \u201cI want a button to show up on the website, and when I click it, it does X action for the user\u201d of course there\u2019s hundreds of examples as anything complex has many moving parts and operations. And then there\u2019s \u201cTasks\u201d within those User Stories that further breakdown each step in the process that needs to be completed. User Stories are also usually stored under an Epic (stores everything for a full project) or a \u201cFeature\u201d (a series of user stories that are required to complete a single function within an application). So, at this time it\u2019s hard not to bring up the idea of Scope, which is a measure of calculated effort and informed guesses at what individual pieces will need to be created/accomplished to complete the project. These higher levels (Epic or Feature) are just ways to group the user stories.   So to actually answer the question, in a scrum, the scrum master is quickly getting an idea of how the defined sprints work is going and helping to communicate and hopefully stopping risks (possible things that could slow the project down or make completing the work more difficult) from becoming issues (work is already being affected from completing). Basically, the idea is to \u201ccontinuously improve\u201d and use failure as a learning tool to make adjustments within a project  That\u2019s a little more than Explain like I'm five years old, but that\u2019s the best I could do ha", "human_ref_B": "1.

Depending on the task I either do it myself or delegate it to a specialist, who then reports the findings back to me. I also evaluate the architecture with respect to non-technical requirements (e.g. how much will this cost, how risky is it to manufacture).  * I spend an awful lot of time checking all adjacent systems and stakeholders and working out solutions for where we \"clash\" (for example there isn't enough space to install two systems, so we have to find a solution - or an adjacent system has changed something, and I need to evaluate what impact this has on my system and find a solution that suits us both.).

Hi,  My partner and I (and our 10 month old puppy) purchased round trip tickets through Spirit Airlines...  Direct flights from Milwaukee, WI to LAX to visit my family for the first time in two years due to the pandemic.  The night before our return trip, we got an email from Spirit saying that our flight was cancelled, and strangely, \"not to try to call or come to the airport\".  The news showed that Spirit had been dealing with this issue for 3 days at that time, with people stranded at the airport for 30 hours in some cases.   We called Spirit multiple times to try to find another flight.  At first, their phone lines would pick up and we'd hold for about an hour and then it would automatically hang up on us.  Eventually, their phone line stopped taking calls and had an automated message that said to use their online chat feature and then hung up on us.  We tried that, but it was unable to book flights with other carriers or offer hotel or food vouchers (the replacement flights Spirit originally offered us all ended up getting cancelled two days later).  I sent an email to Spirit's email complaint forms prior to our expected departure time, stating that we were stranded and sought to get a flight through another carrier, and never heard back from that.  I also went to the airport to extend our rental car and stood in line with Spirit for hours to no avail.  In short, we were stranded in LA with no way to get home and no way to get ahold of the airline we'd booked with and no budget for our extra stay.  We ended up finding the best deal we could find on a flight home through United two days later (flights the same day were over $1000/ticket) and just putting it on a credit card, hopeful that we could fight it out with Spirit if/when we could finally get in touch with them.   The cheapest we could find was $870.40 one-way for the two of us with our dog, two days later (and with a lay-over).  We extended our rental car, and booked the cheapest hotel we could find that would take our dog.  Not to mention, we had to feed ourselves for those days and miss work.  We arrived home late last night.  I've tried to call Spirit multiple times today with no luck.  I was on hold for nearly 30 mins just now and then was hung up on automatically.

At this point, Spirit's poor management decisions cost us over $1700 just to get home from this trip (not including our food and loss of work).

There was a period when I was growing up, when my mom decided she really liked key lime pie, so she would frequently buy them from Costco. Since I was the one with the sweet tooth and healthy appetite, I was the one expected to finish whatever she didn't eat. By the end of that period, I decided I didn't really like key lime pie. There's something about it, some kind of sourness that seems like it's more than just the citrus flavor; there's almost like a kind of yogurt quality to it (I mean like plain unflavored yogurt).   Conversely, I'm still a huge fan of lemon meringue pie. And I mean like the basic Mrs. Smith style, not the fancy stuff that maybe tastes a little more like cheesecake. The lemon part of a lemon meringue pie is almost just lemon pudding or something, it doesn't have that kinda yogurt or whatever element to it.   Okay so, here's the actual baking question. A few days ago, I made this recipe for lemon bars. I think it tastes pretty good overall, but it does have a little bit of that excessive yogurty sourness that I don't really care for. Can anyone offer any theories about what would make it taste like the element of key lime pie that I don't like, instead of just a smooth, sweet lemon flavor?  I should note that I had a bit of a problem with the eggs not quite combining properly. When I first opened the oven to check it, there were a bunch of white splotches like the eggs had just kinda cooked on their own. I broke them up and stirred them back in together with the rest of the filling. I figured the end result was gonna be a lumpy mess, but the texture ended up being pretty smooth. So I don't know if the eggs have anything to do with how it ended up tasting, I just wanted to give all the potentially relevant details.   Also, this is the first recipe for lemon bars I've tried making myself.

I feel like I'm getting no where, I've applied for more 30 jobs that I've hit all the selection criteria. I've had no emails back, or calls, or interviews. I've had 2 interview invitations, but when I tried to arrange a time they disappeared and stopped responding. I've had 2 rejection emails. No-one is willing to provide any feedback. I've cold contacted more than 40 people in senior positions in LinkedIn and emails (no replies).  I've also contacted several HR agencies and they don't reply at all. Theres also a lack of jobs in the area, it takes 4-5 hours of searching for me to find an appropriate job, they are rare.       **Question:**   I feel like there is something majorly wrong with the economics of this industry and job market. I'm convinced that it's not me, and the economics of Research and Development is just broken. I was a fool to not have researched the job market properly before studying Medical Research but there's just no data out there when I started this journey. The career guides had a whole lot of Fictional descriptions of different things that you would do as a medical or biotechnologist, but in reality these industries and companies only existed in Boston or Germany, all the while the universities around the world were producing truckloads of graduates in these fields and specialities. I'm at a stuck point, where I feel like I've pretty much exhausted all my options, and I've done all the spin off side jobs that are related to medical and health jobs, none of them have any stable career path. I want a job where I'm not at risk of losing it every year, and I fall unemployed for a few months after each job. My fear is that one day, the short-term unemployment periods turns into long-term unemployment.      I'm thinking seriously to work part-time 3days/week and potentially study for the Medicine Pre-selection Exam parttime (Called the GAMSAT) 3 days/week, 1 day/week family. Exam is super super difficult and will take a few years to get a good enough score, however, I feel like it is a quantitative measure that I can meaningfully progress in, rather than the zero replies I'm getting from 5months of job applications. After getting into Medicine School I can apply for an Army Study Scholarship $65K/year. I am OK with not getting into Medical School after 5-7 years of trying, at least I can say that I did my best on my death bed.      My Wife is super pissed off at me for suggesting this (Medicine Option), she says I need to support the family by applying for full-time jobs continuously and to talk to HR agencies. She says I'm a coward for trying to run away from the problem by attempting the GAMSAT exam, she doesn't think I will ever pass. I am fully committed to working part-time 3days per week, and get a full time job in the short term to support family however, I'm wary of the pending doom of long term unemployment, and just unviability and competitiveness of research and development jobs. If I can get a full time job in the next 2 months I'll take it, but I can't keep applying for jobs for another half-year or two, it just seems really idiotic and unproductive.

{"post_id": "5kg432", "domain": "changemyview_validation", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "history": "Change my view thatSupposing white (majority) privilege is real, I have no extra duty to right a systemic wrong beyond treating everyone with kindness and fairness. So, accepting that white privilege is an phenomenon that exists in the world, I would describe it as characteristically made up of individuals, usually, but not always, influenced subconsciously by attitudes held by the people of previous generations that raised them.   A person cannot control subconscious attitudes or emotions and can only be responsible for attitudes that they have control over. So then, a person cannot be ethically responsible for actions or attitudes of which they are not cognizant. So if the majority of racial biases that exist in America today are subconscious, then these individuals are not ethically responsible for unfairness that results.  If a person is aware that people of color experience bias from many people who are biased either consciously or unconsciously, we may believe that people have a positive duty to help correct for this unfairness.  But how would a person go about doing this? I'll define being fair as refraining from taking from or depriving someone of something they deserve or failing to give or make available to someone something that they deserve.    Taking the example of being an employer looking through job r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, the hiring manager knows that they likely have some biases that they can't be aware of or even they may be aware. They want to be as fair as possible to all people who apply, so how can they compensate for certain challenges that they know people of color face in particular?  A common option may be the idea of making a quota for people of color in the company and making sure to hire that amount not matter what, except in some extreme circumstances. But while this may seem fair on the face, the classic criticism of this policy is that it ends up being unfair to other individuals who's lives an wellbeing is just as valuable as a person of color's. Since our goal is to be as fair as possible to all applicants, this course of action wont due.  So if we can't help increase fairness for people of color without being unfair to others, then it seems that the only way to help create fairness is to simply be kind and fair to all. **shit, i've run out of characters. Please ask for clarification if needed**  **A common objection to this critique of these types of policies, taken by groups or individuals, is that racism is defined as discrimination, plus power, and therefore, a PoC passed over for a position would likely be worse off than a member of a different group.   I dont believe that this is a compelling critique for the following reasons:  > our definition of fairness or justice, which of course may be disputed, does not and should not, I believe, take into account the projected outcome of certain actions beyond base justice. The logic of this sort of act utilitarianism allows us to justify abhorrent actions and policies in the name of righting social wrongs in order to create fairness. For example, if it were a certainty that decimating the asian population of the united states would make for much more fairness, and therefore, happiness in the county, by the reasoning of act utilitarianism, we could justify this.  However, In the west I think we can agree that we believe fairness and justice in our society as checks on our actions. _____  > *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This all began when I went to a new dentist. When I found out that the dentist operated beside a church on a trailer I began having doubts. This dentist explained that he had a clinic but only used the trailer on the weekends. When it was time for my teeth to be x-rayed the equipment didn't work because of \"internet failure.\" Turns out he was using the church internet. I made the decision not to go back again. A few months pass, and on a whim I decided to check my insurance. While perusing through my insurance, I noticed that I was charged for unrelated services regarding my last dental visit. I was charged for x-ray which I know didn't happen because his equipment didn't work. The most he did was clean my teeth and he charged 150 for that which I was fine with. I went to the facebook page of his clinic and found that other people were also complaining of overcharging. Obviously unhappy I left a negative review saying that I had a bad experience and that he was overcharging. I also contacted my insurance to look into the charges made.

If you live in Rockland County, NY, you might ask your doctor if you should get a booster. * Yes, you can get a polio vaccine in the US. Polio vaccines are required for children to attend school, and they are given to almost all babies and children in the US as a series of 4 shots from age 6 months to 6 years. Your doctor can give you a booster. * There are 3 types of wild polio: type 1, 2, and 3. Types 2 and 3 were eradicated 10-20 years ago. Type 1 is only endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Last year, there were 2 cases. This year so far there were 14 in Pakistan, 1 in Afghanistan, and 4 in Mozambique. * There are two types of vaccine: the oral vaccine contains a live, weakened virus. The shot contains an inactivated virus. You received the oral vaccine, which is no longer given in the US or most developed countries. If you get a booster, you'll get the shot (called the IPV, or inactivated polio vaccine.) * The oral vaccine is being phased out across the world. In fact, there is a new type of vaccine that's replacing both the oral and the IPV vaccines. However, the oral vaccine is still used in some developing countries because it's easier to train people to administer an oral vaccine than a shot, and because the oral vaccine has some useful features (which I'll explain below.) * Polio is transmitted through the oral-fecal route. The virus is shed in a person's feces and ingested by mouth. The polio virus can only live outside of humans for about two weeks, but during that time people can ingest it from contaminated water or soil. No other animal spreads polio, only humans. * The oral vaccine contains a live, weakened virus, which is shed in the vaccinated person's feces. In communities where it's hard to vaccinate everyone \\*and\\* there's poor sanitation, unvaccinated people can catch the weakened virus from vaccinated people. This is actually a feature, because the virus is too weak to make them sick but strong enough to vaccinate them. * The problem arises when fewer than 80% of the population remains unvaccinated for 18 months or more. That gives the weakened virus time to mutate to something stronger (although still not as strong as wild polio) that can cause paralysis in a small percentage of people. This is called \"vaccine-derived\" polio. * The name is a little misleading, because people don't get polio from taking the oral vaccine. Only *unvaccinated* people can get vaccine-derived polio \u2014 but they get it from ingesting food or water that contains the virus that's shed in the feces of people who took the oral vaccine. Even then, they will only get sick if the virus has had at least 18 months to circulate and get stronger. * The people in New York got \"vaccine-derived\" type 2 polio. They got it from traveling to Israel, where the oral vaccine is still used. In New York, the unvaccinated people spread the virus within their own unvaccinated community, and now it's in soil and water. * Health workers make every effort to vaccinate at least 80% of each community within 12 months in order to prevent vaccine-derived polio outbreaks. Whenever there is a \"vaccine-derived\" polio outbreak someplace in the world, health workers launch an intensive effort to get everyone vaccinated as quickly as possible. * There are only a few hundred cases of vaccine-derived polio worldwide each year. * It's unclear to me whether or not the Rockland County community will consent to being vaccinated. If not, they're at risk for continuing to spread polio. However, if they get vaccinated, the outbreak can potentially be contained within a few weeks since the virus can't live outside a human host for longer than two weeks. * I haven't checked into what Israel's doing, but I believe they're working really hard to contain their outbreak.

We could say it is light and darkness or life and death, but the idea might be more complex. Politically, though, Marx believed history was like a wheel turning toward progress. The ultimate goal of history, thus, is to achieve a perfect society where everyone is free and equal. So in the end, there is no need for a state or any control because we would reach the government of everyone by everyone. Capitalism, according to Marx, is at best slowing down progress toward this end. The best way to see this is to understand how capitalism separates things that should be one, like \"capital\" and real value. With capitalism, you \"need money to make money\" because \"capital\" is needed for any workforce to be engaged in work. But Marx would say the workers are the real owners of the result of their work. They are making the thing while the capitalist is barely exploiting people, promising them the right to exploit a bit more at the end of the day, when they receive the paycheck. To Marx, thus, money is ultimately false. It's easy to see it's only a convention that could fall if anybody stops believing in it, but Marx went further by saying capitalism doesn't add any value to the world and that work is the only way to create wealth. The idea, at its root, would be that separing the result of the work from its worth in money is basically wrong. Not because it's so morally bad, but more because it doesn't make sense at all.   * French speaker here.

But more importantly, no.   1. YES: there really isn't a 20th century philosopher out there who isn't in some way responding to or rebelling from a tradition.

The idea that you will start at some foundational point in your philosophical readings (say, Plato) and progress forward, with each step illuminating the last is absurd. You will bring that attitude to Plato, and then realize you have to study the pre-Socratics and one day you'll realize you'll need to learn ancient Greek. Even if you think there is a more proximate place to start, say Kierkegaard or Nietzsche, you will soon realize you cannot really understand them without reading Hegel, which is a lifetime of study in itself. The point is there is no best starting point from the point of view of prior *knowledge*, only a best starting point from the point of view of prior *interest*. If you are thinking of reading Camus it's because you probably know just enough about him to know he might speak to problems that interest you. That is enough to start reading ANY philosopher. It took me years of reading and re-reading to develop a reading of Heidegger, but now he is my guy. This is the other point then: you don't come to grasp the ideas of philosophers one at a time; you read Camus now, it makes some sense, some parts leave you scratching your head; then you read some other stuff, some before, some after, you come back and read Camus later, and you find new connections, understand stuff you didn't before, until one day you sort of sense you grasp Camus. The following (mis)quotation of (maybe Wittgenstein) is good to keep in mind: \"light dawns slowly over the whole.\" This effect will follow you wherever you choose to start. So start wherever you want. 3. ANNND if that doesn't convince you: The Myth of Sisyphus is easily one of the most accessible existentialist philosophical treatises. I ask anyone for proposals for an easier (non-fiction) philosophical work by Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, Husserl, etc. If it's any proof, consider the endless interpretive issues discussed in professional circles about all the latter authors.

{"post_id": "zu0mvh", "domain": "askdocs_validation", "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "history": "Why doctors' first instinct is to be skeptical over the top? Five months ago, I (29M, 6 ft., 156 lbs., mixed latino middle eastern) started to feel arrhythmias, chest pain, fatigue, and whenever I woke up, my mouth would be so dry that sometimes I would taste blood in my throat and I've swallowed it. I went to the doctor, and she used the stethoscope, made some other really basic tests and found nothing. So, her first reaction was to tell me it was just anxiety -- even though I go to the therapist and we both agree I am in perfect mental condition with no worries besides being worried for my heart's health -- and ask how did I know I had blood in my throat if I never saw it. And I was like \"WTF?! I know the taste of my own blood! Why is sight a good criterion but other senses like taste are to be ignored?\"  Months later, and after basically fighting a war against everyone in my healthcare service, they finally found evidence that I indeed have something: a slight offset in my EKG. They explained that the last line of the EKG was offset by 6 little squares when the maximum is 5. So now they will be start doing more tests. Finally!  But this is not the first time this happens to me: I have a neurological complex condition from childhood that started with daily tantrums so big that they ended with me fainting. I'm no doctor, but fainting after a tantrum doesn't seem just a psychological condition to me. However, docs said I was just a spoiled child and were constantly threatening my mum with sending social services for me. After several years of constant pushing, my mum finally got them to actually send me to tests and found that I have an arachnoid cyst pushing the temporal lobe and a hypoactive frontal lobe, and they had an opportunity to scan me while being in a \"tantrum\" and found out that they were actually hour long seizures. They started medication and my seizures weakened to the point where I only have one every \\~four years. Afterwards, occasionally I have had other neurological symptoms (body disobeying my conscious self, traditional epileptic seizures, headaches and migraines, jaw muscles tensing so hard that I think my bones will be crushed by them, etc.) and every single time I -- or previously my mum-- have had to fight to prove the doctors that we were not just being paranoid. It's exhausting. And I experienced this with many doctors in many institutions.  But after talking with other people with disabilities and chronic illnesses, I've heard that same story over and over again: Getting a diagnostic is a war against doctors. And it does not seem to matter what institution it is or who the patient is: Britain, US, Mexico, private sector, public sector, women, men, healthy looking, sick looking, John Doe, Celine Dion, everyone has that same horror story.  So, I cannot stop wondering: Why? I don't want to be judgemental -- even if it is really hard from my side -- Is it something about your training? I know everyone seems to think they know about medicine  because of Daddy Google and Aunt Karen Essential-Oils and you have to be skeptical of evidence, and I heard that tests have the risk of creating false positives and one should not test just because, but from my side, there should be easy solutions that don't involve the need for your patients to wage war against you 24/7 just to get diagnosed. Or is it so common for people to be paranoid and/or hypochondriac that we people who actually have something are being self-selected within patients' groups so that we are not seeing the other side? What is happening?!  And, finally, some tips that would help actually informed patients to get you to know that we are actually informed and are not being paranoid would be highly appreciated and sorry if this sounded accusatory: I am genuinely trying to understand, but this is exhausting.

In theory, you are not allowed to discriminate against people on the basis of a 'protected' class, but that doesn't mean that it won't happen with said restrictions. There is nothing stopping people from singling out random people they don't like for whatever reason and accusing them of breaking the rules. We've already seen hate crimes against Asians for being the supposed spreaders of the disease.  It's the same reason why I am skeptical of vaccine passports. Plenty of progressives believe that voter identification is not just a bad idea, but is racist. The argument is that the states they live in will deliberately avoid giving them their I.D. either on time, or at all.   This also applies to the vaccine passports. If it is true that minorities have a lesser take up rate (be it from willing refusal or lack of coverage in poorer areas) does that not create the same effect as the Voter I.D. would? Also, what happens in younger people have not or cannot be vaccinated due to short supply?  I am not outright opposed to private companies utilising anti-mask or anti-vax bans, but I think we should be very careful when giving companies these kinds of powers over what are sometimes incredibly subtle or difficult to prove thing. Say someone was a racist and hated black people. Nothing stopping them 'taking' their mask from them, taking a video of that person angry, cutting out important things, and posting it to a subreddit making fun of anti-maskers and supporting their use of powers. Under normal circumstances, people might see the race and ask questions as to why such a massive response was taken (race always come up, for better or worse) but the perfect excuse is that they were breaking 'the rules'. It's a perfect cop-out. No one will oppose it.  People like to argue that 'what about clothes, they make them wear that, right?'. It isn't the same. You cannot 'fake' that kind of problem, unless you intend to fully strip someone there and then. I may not need proof to boot someone out of my store if I accuse them of being anti-vaccine. They might not have their I.D., they may have I.D. but it looks fake, they might be unlucky enough to lose it. If someone held a prejudice against Asians, they might deliberately only focus their efforts on ensuring that they had the correct stuff with them, not dissimilar to how many accuse police of being racist with stop and search.  I do not necessarily think businesses wanting to enact certain restrictions are bad, but I think businesses and governments need to be really careful when rolling out this kind of restriction. Often, these restrictions are vague, falsifiable and can lead to serious problems down the line when companies abuse it to be prejudiced. There are still plenty of places in the world where gay people cannot donate aids because of the fear of HIV.  On another note, private businesses are saying that they may enact mandates, but for lack of a better word, most are virtue signalling. All businesses are struggling, and the moment things open up, its back to business as usual. They will want as many customers as possible, and 'safety' will likely not be their concern anymore.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 37202.0, "score_ratio": 1.5}

After seeing how bad it gets, I\u2019ve never been this concerned about the air quality.  Besides what we already do on our own to reduce our carbon footprint, what could we do to improve the air quality in Salt Lake City?  (Or any areas that have the geography to create a smog bubble.)  Would it even be possible to create a couple hundred tubes that ran up the mountain, or through each canyon, where on the inside of the tubing there would be very large fans ever mile or so, creating a \u201cvent\u201d, essentially sucking the smog and low pressure air out from underneath the high density bubble up, out over the mountains, relieving the area of pollutants?
