I'm a PhD student in a Pharmacology program.  I don't work 12 hours a day.  I work closer to 7-9 hours during the week and pick up a couple of hours on the weekend if I need to for experiments/deadlines.  On average, I work 40-50 hours a week.  A weekday for me would look something like this (no classes):  * 6:15 AM: wake up, get ready (hair, makeup, feed cat, etc), brush teeth, check the weather, eat a light breakfast like cereal * 7:45-8:15 AM: arrive to lab, look at my list of duties and calendar, plan my day, work, read, etc * 4:45-6:15 PM: get home, this varies depending on my workday * 4:50 PM: Go for a jog (~3-4 miles, 30 minutes) * 5:30 PM: shower/meal prep * 6:00 PM: dinner and netflix/hulu/TV * 7:00 PM: feed and love cat/clean up/dishes/start laundry/grocery shop/etc * 8:00 PM: check e-mail/read/free-time * 10-11 PM: sleep  There is a lot that can vary in this schedule in the evening for me based on my needs.  I have a lot of time to spend to grocery shop, run errands, do laundry, clean, maintain personal hygeine, etc.  Honestly, you just have to make time for chores and the other things on your list like any other working adult.  Some tips I have that make my life easier:  * The slow cooker is one of my best friends for cooking.  I'll throw in some meat with seasoning in the morning on low, come home, shred it, chop up some veggies I picked up from the store the night before, and I have some easy meat and veggies for tacos or a rice bowl.  I make a bunch so I have leftovers to freeze or refridgerate. * If you have trouble picking out clothing or getting ready in the morning, set out your clothes the night before * When you're at work, spending time working.  Oftentimes, if I hear of a PhD spending 12-14 hours a day in the laboratory, I can almost guarantee that person is not constantly working while they are there or their advisor is a jerk.  Take breaks, sure, but set out your tasks ahead of time and work to get them done. * Planning a schedule or writing down my work tasks for a day helps me manage my time at work better than just keeping a mental note of all the things I need to do. * No one tracks my hours so if I need to step out to go to the post office or to a dr's appointment during the day I can.  No one gets upset at me.  Just make time for those things. * For a pet, I have a cat.  My cat does a pretty good job at maintaining herself without me there all the time.  I feed her in the morning, feed her at night, clean her litter box, and spend some time with her.  She doesn't need constant monitoring, she's a pretty low maintenance pet to have.  I know students who have dogs and they make it work.", "human_ref_B": "For a lot of these, it's just about getting good at time management and developing consistency.

Like any job, there will be weeks where you have downtime and weeks where you need to kick into overdrive for crunchtime. You have to actively reach out to people if you want to stay in touch, but realistically my friends and family know that maybe we'll only really talk biweekly, or mostly chat online or something. Repairs and whatnot are generally not a constant drain on time.  I shop once a week, do laundry once a week or every other week, clean every other week or so, and do dishes daily. An hour and a half for exercise every day is *a ton,* at that point you could safely raise the intensity and decrease the duration for a more effective workout. And people do rotations for a reason.  As a PhD student, your hours are very flexible- you need to put in work, a lot of people like to keep a schedule i.e. I try to be in lab from 9:30 to 6, not counting class times. But you can also much more easily dip out to go to the bank in the middle of the day if needed. Some people have biology experiments/protocols that require 4 hours in between steps, so it's not like you can't knock out other stuff during that time. I don't have a pet. I have to care for sick family members, but in my situation that's mostly a commitment I can stick to on weekends- other people may not have that luxury.", "labels": 1, "seconds_difference": 489.0, "score_ratio": 4.7619047619}

Some Background:   I graduated recently with my PhD and I have been trying to turn my dissertation chapters into published articles. My supervisor has been sitting on these manuscripts for months \\(one since November \\-\\-\\- 5 months ago\\) saying he hasn't found the time to read them and send feedback. This is despite the fact that I stressed to him several times how critical these publications were to me getting a job and building a career \\(I do not yet have any publications from my PhD time\\). I was lucky enough to secure a post\\-doc anyways, despite my publication record \\(although  I lost out on 3 before that specifically for that reason\\), on the premise that these publications were forthcoming.  The Current Issue:  I was not able to attend a major conference this year, but a colleague contacted me to tell me they saw \"my poster,\" which I didn't know I had.  It turns out my former supervisor had made a conference poster based on a chapter from my dissertation without telling me. In fact, the graphs are copy and pasted from the chapter/manuscript that he \"hasn't had time to read\" since November. Moreover, he listed himself as the first author and as far as I can tell didn't even cite my dissertation \\(My friend sent me a blurry picture of the poster\\). He did list me as the second author.  So, I could use some advice.  1.\\) Is this unethical behavior? My instinct is that it's at least borderline unethical, but I don't want to blow this out of proportion. The fact that he did not tell me bothers me for several reasons including not knowing to add the poster to my CV \\(which I need since he hasn't let me publish\\) and the fact that I feel like he gave himself more credit for this work than he deserves \\(Yes, it's his lab's research but I did a significant proportion of the work involved\\).  2.\\) Should I say something? If this is unethical behavior, I do not think I should let it slide as that will only encourage him to do stuff like this to future students, nor do I want to set a precedent of being a push\\-over \\(for myself and to others\\). Also, he has been delaying publications for months and months and yet had the time to make a poster based on the work that he claims he hasn't had the time to get to.   3.\\) If I am going to say something, do you have any advice on what I should say or how I should frame the issue?   I am worried about how this will play out in the future. I no longer need a letter of recommendation from this person for jobs \\(which is why I held my tongue in regards to previous issues I had with him\\), but I do need to finish several publications with him which I really need for my career and to show my current job I wasn't BS'ing about having forthcoming publications.

Hopefully this is the right place. Overall, I'm in a position where I am conflicted, and torn on how to proceed in academia. I think mostly, I am looking for some advise from other academics who have had similar experiences, or who have any insight in what I can do.    I have been at the same institution for almost 10 years now. I was an undergrad student, research assistant, grad student, adjunct, substitute lecturer, instructor, assistant professor, director of a lab, and director of the undergraduate program for 2 years. I was able to do all this within a 6 year time frame. Recently, I have been out on parental leave. I have worked extremely hard to climb the academic ladder, and I feel pretty content with how successful I have been.   Here is where the real fun comes in. My chair, has to be one of the most toxic individuals one could meet. To give context with my leave alone, I told her 5 months in advance I was going to use my parental leave (contractual right). Her response \"You are a father you should not be taking leave\", \"your wife isn't working, so she can take care of the baby\", \"this is unfair to the program and you should not be asking for leave\". To top things off, my wife was a high risk pregnancy (2 prior miscarriages) and my mom had stage 4 lung cancer. My mom ended up passing on Aug 14th of this year. From diagnosis to her passing, it was 5 months. To say this took a toll on me is an understatement. Meanwhile, the chair knew everything I was going through, and her response to my mom passing was \"time to get back to real life\". My leave officially started in October, and I received emails that were full of things that should not be said to anyone let alone someone already struggling with other life experiences. I've been in contact with the dean and she just says \"I dont know why she treats you like this\". The chair says \"hes like a son to me\" as if its some excuse to justify the abuse. She threatens that there are consequences, and told me I am shooting myself in the foot for now doing what she says. This was sent to the dean, union, and legal counsel. They told her to leave me alone during leave, but it will, without a doubt continue. After forwarding the harassing emails, the dean went MIA and hasn't said a word in months. I got in contact with my union, legal counsel and HR and they basically told her to leave me alone. From October until this past week, she left me alone. Now the emails start again. Nothing toxic, but right back to as if things are normal and what she did is just acceptable. This experience is only the recent one, I have recordings, and emails from the past 10 years of things similar and perhaps worse. She is short tempered, and respects no one. She, and other say its just her culture (shes turkish). Its still mind boggling to me that if this were any other job, she would have been fired. There are recordings others have sent the union of her being racist. Yet, she still continues as if nothing has happened.   The overall response from the dean was \"I need her as chair\". The chair is tenured, and intends to retire in 3 years. I don't want to see, hear or have anything to do with this woman. Just the thought of speaking with her gives me extreme anxiety. I wish this was an exaggeration, but every single interaction I have had with her has been abusing, toxic. Sadly, I am not alone in this. There has been at least 6 people who have left because of her, and the union said they aren't sure why she is still here. yet nothing is done, and the dean and other just say \"that is just how she is\". I fully intend to leave, and my last semester will be Spring 2024. I don't know what to do til then. I wish I could just quit, but i am the sole provider for my family. The pay isn't great, but I am a city employee, so the healthcare is extremely important.   I would sincerely appreciate any suggestions, words of wisdom or any guidance on what to do. No need to sugar coat anything, because I need to hear what needs to be said. I have justified the abuse, and have been convinced by others that I just have to deal with her behavior.

I agreed to peer review an opinion/review paper for a journal. No authors or institutions were listed as the journal wanted to blind us.

Turns out the author copied paragraphs of text verbatim from a separate project that I\u2019m involved with and wrote the background for. Same text, same references, everything. The project details are not publicly available yet, so only the project team has had access to this document along with select reviewers. Additionally I found text copied from email correspondences that I had with a few team members in the manuscript and were portrayed as this individual\u2019s commentary, so I\u2019m pretty confident I know who this person is now.  To make things even more absurd, I previously reviewed a paper where the suspected individual was the lead author (was not blinded for that one) and noticed the background section was copied from another online resource. I let the editor know about this issue at the time and advised that the section be revised and cite back to the online resource. At the time I tried to give this person the benefit of the doubt so left it at that.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am currently working Post-PhD and have a good number of papers out (h-index >20).  I am struggling with irrational feelings when it comes to the work of others, and I want to work on that. Some of this I potentially can attribute to some experiences during my Ph.D. that I will detail later.  At its core, I am getting jealous of my co-workers for their success. If someone submits a paper and gets good reviews, I have a hard time feeling happy for them. On this note, I also have issues celebrating my own success. Whenever there is work that I think is subpar, I feel that they had it easy. This is particularly the case when I see people making quick studies, e.g., when the project and publication process runs smoothly. Whenever I see that a co-worker does solid work, I get envious and think why I didn\u2019t do this. I then have the feeling that they have found their niche, and I am sad that I don\u2019t have mine - although I probably, objectively have one.   The absurd thing is that this is even the case when I am a co-author of a study - so even when I would benefit from my colleagues\u2019 success.  From my Ph.D. I instilled some unhealthy \u201crules\u201d from a very ambitious PI. Some of them are obviously very questionable, but those are some of the first thoughts that come up in my mind and might help to rationalize what I am feeling:  1. You need to be the first or corresponding author of a study so that it has value. >> I guess this is why I don\u2019t value being \u201cjust\u201d a co-author on a paper. 2. The value of a paper is dependent on the journal. >> Before I see myself asking what the study is about, I rather think about the journal. 3. My Ph.D.-PI had very high standards and would become very nit-picky. >> e.g., when I find a typo, I devalue work disproportionally and assume the findings won\u2019t hold up. I get angry when I see published work that has questionable data quality 4. Once you finish a paper, directly move on to the next one. >> I have a hard time reflecting and celebrating success - or rather acknowledging success. I often talk my work down. I recently published a paper with very good reviews and then had nagging thoughts that others published in higher-impact journals.  This often leads to the feeling that I am glad that it is over and not that I achieved something, as there is always something \"better\".  5.

Background: Did a BA in a terrible uni (did not learn anything there), ended up in an MA in Japan with little to no knowledge about anything. Spent the past 2 years dedicating my life to catching up (but impostor syndome is always strong...)   So It's about time I finish my dissertation, and I'm in a bit of a conundrum. Mainly, I'm not sure I'm qualified to be writing this.   Background about Japan: They read&publish *a lot*. Stephen king would be considered lazy in this country. It's the kind of country where people who say that they don't read still read hundreds of titles, where even minor issues have dozens of books written about it, and most major academics have 30+ books to their name, most of them in response to other 30-book academics in a manner in which you don't get it unless you've read all of them.   My dissertation is basically a Japanese author, Japanese subculture theory, and queer theory.  On a personal level, I think I'm pretty solid; I've read a lot about and by my author (though she's published 50 titles so by no means all), I think I get her, I can definitely see the patterns, etc. Been reading theory like mad these past 2 years, by now I'm pretty solid about understanding it, perhaps not so much in writing it. But delving into the Japanese part is giving me serious impostor syndrome.   Basically, all the papers about my author tend to revolve around the same things. They're pretty much intertwined, with very little contradictions; I agree with most interpretations and definitely feel them. But I feel inadequate in taking on the Japanese theory since, well, my life is too short to read all of it. I like reading the theory, I feel that I understand it quite well, but it references many thousand-page series, academic squabbles drawn out over dozens of books, and so on. I'm a fast reader, but the literary background would be a solid 10 years worth of reading, and that's not counting the things that are published in the meantime. then there's Japanese literary theory&history which is, again, a quagmire. Most of them have nothing to do with what I'm writing about, but I feel like an impostor for relying on it superficially. It's made worse by the fact that I often read foreigners writing superficially about Japan, and I definitely feel like I'm being judged for writing about Japanese lit when I'm not insanely well-read (nor Japanese).   TL;DR: as a rule of thumb, where is a point where you can stop and say 'ok, I've read enough to have a good grasp of things'?

Because when I started I had some solid grasp of some little things but after I had some slight grasp of a lot of big things, and if felt on balance like this was less.

Everyone I know prefers the student who asks too many questions over the student who doesn't ask anything.  Students who don't ask questions end up costing us way more time in the end.

However, I was dismissed following my viva under the guise of \"poor writing\" in a continuation report for transfer into the 2nd year. Initially shocked at this sudden change from my supervisor, as we meet weekly to touch base and my writing ability has never been raised as a concern. Going back through the assessors feedback comments from the initial draft, it was generally positive or constructive. i.e make figure x larger, move paragraph y above z. Overall, the report and oral viva were praised for well thought out discussions, sound methodology, good results and clear progression/future plans (all documented) with just a vague \"introduction is poorly written\". However, when pressed the assessor could not/would not expand on this, dismissing me with \"its all poor\" contrary to the feedback he himself had provided! I was told my only options at this stage are to \"withdraw from your course, or submit an MPhil but I will not accept it\". Thus I am appealing this verdict.  After speaking with various staff and peers it has become obviously clear to everyone who has heard the situation that you would not remove someone for poor writing, if that is indeed the case. Institutional guidelines recommend to advise relevant training, workshops, exercises and teaching to address a students weaknesses. I believe this serves as wrongful dismissal/ not adhering to due process of the university. So I've raised this further to the senior staff.  It has also come to my attention that the lab I was part of is notorious for politics and shady conduct. The student who had the project before me was bullied into leaving. In addition to a high staff turn-over, improper conduct and breaches of contract. From what I hear the uni does nothing about it because the head brings in too much money. \"Poor writing\" just seems to be the excuse to get rid of me, or the project is cursed! Advice on how to navigate this matter would be appreciated.  If the appeal goes through it's doubtful I'll get my previous post/project back as there is too much bad blood. I wouldn't be comfortable remaining at the university if I was moved to another lab/project, if there is systematic abuse and underhanded deals going on. My supervisor is not happy about me digging around/appealing so wouldn't give me a shining reference so seek positions elsewhere.  I've kept and backed up logs of meetings where no measures were put in place, emails where the supervisor, team and peers have all said the report was of a good standard, and presentations where no concerns were raised. At its core it began as a wrongful dismissal and academic appeal, but the more I look into it, ask around and hear from others experiences with the lab.

In general, the situation in your department does not look conductive to doing research. Given the nature of your university, moving to a different school, even a lateral move to another teaching school (with better working conditions) may be very difficult to pull off.  If you are mobile, and can afford to move around the country in pursuit of a soft-money research position, or a post-doc, this may indeed work.  Do you have any academic connections that might help? E.g., perhaps your advisor knows of a research group somewhere that could use your skills and have funding. If you are still maintaining some relationship with your advisor, you might want to call him/her up and ask the same questions.  Not knowing your exact research discipline, your research area, your prior research, the exact school you are in, who your advisor was, and what school your Ph.D. is from, it is difficult to provide precise advice. Your advisor, or another senior colleague (from outside of your department) whom you trust may provide a more context-aware sage advice.", "human_ref_B": "> 5-17 hr teaching loads, tons of service, people quitting left and right....\"10% research load\"..... no research no tenure  where is this hell  where is it so i can avoid it and warn others", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 31336.0, "score_ratio": 1.1666666667}

However, I can't quit this PhD (has to do with my visa status and my partner's job, so please don't recommend that I just quit).    I'm a firm believer in not complaining about something unless something can be done to fix the situation. However, I'm finding it really emotionally draining to smile and say everything is fine when I dread going into work and find myself crying on the bus home occasionally.

I don't want to be insulting their country, and I know that it's in my best interest to just finish and get out.

They did mention that they could push the final date up a few months if it was requested.   Just as a side note, during my first six months, I really pushed to get the old project back and to also have them allow me to do my own research. We had one 3-hour meeting in which they made it very clear that I was to do exactly what they specified on this project or else the PhD wasn't going to work.    *To keep it brief: I moved to another country for it, and the process of getting set up (visa, bank accounts, social security number, etc.) is an ongoing administrative nightmare that leaves me exhausted every day and having to work from home way more than anyone else; the office is extremely gossippy with my coworkers knowing the intimate details of my weaknesses before I do; my thesis topic was changed before I arrived and is something I have no interest in; I'm told what to do in every aspect (essentially I'm an engineer implementing my supervisors' ideas); and my direct supervisor is a yes woman who throws me under the bus in nearly every meeting and blindly agrees to the other supervisors' suggestions even after I've spent months researching those ideas and have demonstrated that they're not viable.", "c_root_id_A": "f92lgmu", "c_root_id_B": "f92mlij", "created_at_utc_A": 1575035833, "created_at_utc_B": 1575036956, "score_A": 6, "score_B": 32, "human_ref_A": "I think you should ask about finishing up early without mentioning how unhappy you are.

Could be different where you are at, but if you are already seeing a therapist I would probably just stick with that.  My advice on continuing forward in this unhappy situation is to try to do at least one thing a day that makes you happy. Set aside some time each day to just do something you want to do. Whenever you're feeling overwhelmed and upset, just try to focus on one thing you're doing later that you know will make you feel just a little bit better.

Luckily my supervisors spoke English well but my colleagues in my lab did not. The administration is a complicated, the people can be cold and standoffish, and the atmosphere can quickly become depressing.  Secondly, my advice about the country: Take a deep breath and get proactive. This country is known for its standoffish people when it comes to language. BUT there are many expats and travellers here. I advise you to seek out other international PhD students in your team/lab/building/university. Look for English Libraries and join in. Check your doctoral school and attend a mixer or two. 100% there are other international students who are struggling too, and there are probably PhDs of the country who can speak English and would be willing to help here and there for translation. Build your support network!  Thirdly, administration. It gets easier after the first year after you are in the system. I know it sucks to get all the cards and forms and applications filled in. But it WILL get simpler. After my third year I didn't even blink an eye at the paperwork anymore, just keep on top of it! Do it immediately and keep copies of all the documents in a folder so when you have to apply for residene permits etc. again, you have it already.  Lastly, and probably the most important for you, your PhD and supervisors. I assume you are in your first year? Honestly, if you feel the need to quit do it. There is no shame in it and it takes immense strength to look at the big picture of your life and say \"This isn't working\". But, if you feel you might want to continue, you'll need to consider a few things. HR is not your friend. Seek counselling if you can (there should be free services available to you, speak to the International Researchers office of your university to find resources - ask for counselling options and help with administration). As for your supervisors - only you know how bad it really is. I would not directly approach your supervisors and tell them you're not happy. I don't think they would be receptive to this.  But I strongly advise you to learn the language of the country. STRONGLY. Spend this holiday time putting in the energy and work. It will help you  immeasurably. The fact is, you are in their country and you need to speak the language. If they laugh at your poor grammar, who cares as long as you can communicate! If you choose to stay, take their behaviour towards you as part of the PhD - you need to defend your ideas, vision, and data. Take it as a learning experience, you will be a force to reckon with when you succeed. Good luck!

{"post_id": "9um4wx", "domain": "askacademia_test", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "history": "Dealing with students' unrealistic expectations about their grades and education in general (in US) I am a PhD student at a decent school in US, I am also a long time teaching assistant (my fifth year) and for all these years, the class that I was a TA for has been about the same subject, which is also my research topic. My interactions with students are my weekly office hours and grading their exams and assignments. This is where the problem begins: After every homework or exam that I grade, many students come challenging their grades by saying a variation of (i) \"My answer is same as the solution manual but I didn't get full credit.\", (ii) \"My solution is correct and solution manual is wrong.\" or (iii) \"My solution is same as my friend's but my grade is lower.\"  Aside Info: Even if the subject (taught at this level) is not really mathematical -other than being able to do primary school operations on numbers and comparing them with each other-, I guess it requires some sort of mathematical maturity to avoid fallacies. So answers to each question requires a \"proof,\" even though it is usually a one-liner but the students often lack the background to do it, which is somewhat surprising since most of them are seniors with some juniors at a good university.  I don't know the institutional reasons for the lack of background of the students and I understand that it may not be their fault that they were allowed to take this class without the proper background. However, I cannot possibly teach them proof techniques or basic logic either. I mean, they don't even need to write technical proofs, I just need a decently complete arguments about why some simple statement is true or false. To make this easier for them, I always write very clear solutions to each question after they submit their work, explain it step by step and show/argue that if you omit even one step, the answer would be incomplete.  Here is an example that illustrates the type of answers I get very often: \"Every prime number other than 2 is odd since for example 3 is odd.\" (The actual subject concerns much simpler problems but this shows the type of fallacies I deal with on a daily basis.) Then, they argue that they deserve full credit, since they rightfully argued that \"Every prime number other than 2 is odd\".  I explain that their end result might be correct but their method is not; that this class is all about teaching the methods, and finally that the question explicitly requires an explanation which should be correct for the answer to be considered correct, hence they don't deserve full credit for it. (I feel embarrassed that I need to say things like this since it feels like an insult to their intelligence; if the question is not a multiple choice or \"Fill in the black\", these should be fairly obvious. Yet, I dealt with this for years now.) Then, they complain to the professor about this. I talk to the professor about it and we have a good laugh. (I don't remember any instance where a professor sided with the students about this issue and the professors are some of the top people in this field in the world so at this point I am fairly confident about my grading system.) This process repeats itself every week, every year.  I am sorry, I haven't had chance to rant about this in a while so I got a little carried away while trying to give some background. So, is there a systematic solution to my problem? What are your suggestions? I think I will suggest to the professor that we upload a practice problem set with the detailed solutions next term before the deadline for the first homework to set their expectations about our expectations but I don't know if this will work.

Then I got to college and every professor pointed out that is how NOT to do it.  As far as helping the students, I always suggest Shaum's Outlines for courses where applicable (got me through PhD level Quantum Mechanics)  You also have the issue of dealing with \"smart\" students.

I suspect one systemic reason is how ingrained grade-grubbing is in US student culture, so you'll get some base number of these people no matter what you do.  Some strategies that help is reiterating what you said here in class (i.e. don't tell only people who individually come to your office that they need to show their work - announce it in class). If they're still not getting it, go through a recent problem set and point out what you need to see and what people aren't doing. If you present basic logic as a basic expectation, that'll shame some people into being decent. Remember that your materials are never as clear as you think they are, so it's usually a good idea to go through them.  Another option is to give students leeway so they don't feel pressured to turn in all perfect work. A common thing to do is have n-k problem sets apply to their grade, so students have k problem sets to screw up/not do/exercise their free will with. ime this also raises morale.   But also, if you see such a glaring deficiency with the whole class, why not go through basic logic with them? Like, why not do a 10 minute presentation on why 3 being prime doesn't prove that all prime numbers after 3 are odd? Educating them isn't an insult to their intelligence.

I'm wondering whether anyone out there has ever received, or created, a \"starter pack\" of papers like that? If so, how did you give / get them? Is this something you think would be useful for incoming students or for someone switching subspecialties?  I can imagine one argument against starter-packs being that a new grad student should learn on their own how to dig through the literature of their field. While it's true that one does need to acquire that skill, I think any student would pick that up by the end of their PhD no matter what.

You are setting out on a course to be an international level scholar with a unique expertise.

I was amazed at the people in my area who had never read seminal papers that their work was based on. If you are one of the people who do like to read, you don't need anyone's help. Start with the textbooks and just go read the original papers they cite. You will read hundreds and hundreds of shitty papers to find a dozen gems. You will find that often modern interpretations of classic papers are exactly backwards (Stephan J. Gould wrote an essay on this once). You will find errors in authors, procedures, and interpretations that have been passed from one lazy academic to another. It's amazing how frequently papers get cited from other papers rather than being read- just like lazy undergraduates. You will spend hours in the library since the good stuff isn't available online. You will order stuff from interlibrary loan (and I don't care how good your school's library is). You may find yourself picking up a reading knowledge of a second language (much of the classic physiology literature is in German and French for instance). Third, if you can't get started on this journey yourself then you should reconsider grad school. Harsh, but true. Simply grab a textbook or a classic review paper (use World of Knowledge or whatever ISI calls it these days to grab a high impact review from 10-20 years ago) and start reading it and the stuff it cites. You don't want to follow the herd on this one, you are becoming a scholar so it's time you learned to dig stuff up for yourself and form your own opinions about it.

I don't have any idea about a math specific job though, I'm obviously mostly a coder at the moment, though I've been building my network for a hop to one of the data science departments in the next year or something. You just have to be strategic about it, you know? I have my things I'm super excited to be self studying (representation learning, among other things) and then... I've got the boring stuff I learn because it makes it much easier to open the career doors I see ahead of me. AWS and docker at the moment. Last month I did a deep dive into multithreading in Python. It's fucking messy when you're in love with elegant solutions from math, but c'est la vie. In some ways being able to extract a clean set of definitions and axioms and a systemic understanding from a messy programming spec is one of the best things I've gotten from math when it comes to making money, haha.  If you DO choose to use your actual schooling for something too esoteric to be valuable though... consider picking up coding as a hobby at least. It's a really, really nice skill to fall back on, and if you're good, you can potentially track your way into a career where math actually IS relevant if you're a competent coder. That's been my limited experience at least. Check out leetcode if you want coding as a hobby by the way. Bite sized programming challenges where the math/conceptual side is harder than the coding side can make for a good bridge if you're looking for a painless way to bolster your hire-ability. it's a whole lot easier to jump into the proper software engineering stuff after a year or two of poking around on the side, you know?  Either way, if you do go way down the rabbit hole, your number one danger will be focusing too hard on the specific stuff you know. Nobody will care, and you'll convince people you're too out of touch to be a practical hire. 'enter the conversation already going on in the mind of the customer' is the mantra. Nobody will care about operator theory, but if you can tie it in only when relevant, talk intelligently about it when asked, and stay razor focused on what the hiring agent (or whoever) actually cares about, there's nothing that'll bar the doors for you, so long as you hit the pavement hard enough.", "human_ref_B": "Depending on the specific problem you tackle in operator theory, you could probably transition into industrial machine learning quite easily.

You can see many examples of cultures using reciprocity-based economy as way to distribute goods. Best described in this aspect are cultures of New Guinea and Melanesia. There's for example  a phenomenon of \"big men\" as described by an anthropologist Marshal Sahlins where leaders of individual groups compete against each other in generosity and ability to provide for each other, to become the titular big man who balances the best redistributing goods in his own group and exchanging gifts with other groups. In the modern times, the leaders may use money to buy all the things but within their group, goods are redistributed by them and in that way there's no use for their own money. I recommend you a 1970's documentary *Ongka's Big Moka* about one such exchange (in the light of the tradition dying out).  A classic essay *The Gift* by Marcel Mauss explains a reciprocity-based economy and provides more different examples. You can often hear people saying that people in the past used barter and as the society grew larger and jobs differentiated, it was replaced by money as a logical consequence. In fact, we don't really know whether barter was ever used as a main, society-wide economic system, rather it was the reciprocity-based economy.", "human_ref_B": "So, I\u2019m a economist rather than an anthropologist, but here\u2019s my understanding as what I focus on in part is properties of money, money systems, and the development of national currency.   To begin, as another suggested, you can check out David Graeber for an exploration of this - however, I\u2019d warn that Graeber provides us an anthropology of debt and credit systems... not money. He specifically doesn\u2019t cover the era that territorial monies such as standardized coinage emerged (he ends his analysis in the 1600s).   Eric Helleiner is someone you should check out. In particular, his book on territorial currencies. The answer to your question is that coinage is not common. The Greek city states are earlier forms of this development, but it\u2019s not to state it as a necessary stage in the development of money and nor has it been historically required to facilitate trade. The coinage systems we see emerging entering the industrial revolution are very different, and standardized in order to push other systems of denomination out of circulation. Earlier forms of coinage didn\u2019t have this purpose, but were usually done in a non-standard way (e.g., hammer imprinting and very non-standard) to facilitate trade internationally and in the name of a new King, etc.   In short - there\u2019s nothing special about coinage over and above, say, cowrie shells. I think the answer to your question has to do with the social development of the group in question, their goals (e.g., is there a sovereign trying to coordinate resources to some end?), and their relative place in the global economic structure at the time.   For more in depth reading, I again recommend Eric Helleiner. For something having to do with coinage from antiquity rather than the era of nation states I recommend Michael Hudson, an economist, who has also done some very good work on this with other anthropologists. Alex Semenova and his work on monies in antiquity around the Mediterranean would be of interest to you. G. K. Ingham, A. Mitchell Innes and L. Randall Wray is another grouping that has a credit/state theory of money that may interest you, but it doesn\u2019t answer why one would chose coinage over anything else. Hopefully that helps!  Edit: To make my point more clear with a question. If others coinage is good and plenty to allow internal/external circulation, you have access to it, and it meets your needs... why coin your own money? Just trade. You only coin if you have other social/political goals beyond this with strangers.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 124.0, "score_ratio": 2.5}

Natural selection can only work with the genes that are already present.  Let's say there's a shift to more salinity in a fresh water lake.  There are species A-D of fish in that lake.  All species are under the same selective pressure, Species A just don't have the genes to handle salt water and they go extinct (at least in that lake). Species B also just doesn't have any of the right genes but continue to exist in some shrunken sickly state. For Species C, 1 in 100 fish happened to have one copy of odd gene that helps with salinity.  The fish that have the gene flourish while those who don't die.  So species C survives just fine BUT the frequency of that special gene changes, now pretty much 99 out of 100 fish have at least one copy of it, and many have 2 copies.  Species D has a similar gene but most fish of that species already had it, because it gave them some other benefit as well (it allowed them to live in the shallow waters which froze solid), so they are living their lives just fine.  Now, due to both mild levels of solar radiation, and because our genes on rare occasions don't copy themselves perfectly new mutations happen.  But these are totally random, there is no guiding hand of nature that 'helps'.  So MAYBE species B eventually mutates and that mutation happens to be one that helps with salt water (which is as lucky as getting a winning lottery ticket - it's extremely rare)  But remember, it's random.  So, early humans were like that.  They spread from heavy sunlight with lots of chances to get vitamin D (fresh water) to areas with less sunlight in the winter (salty water)  EVERYBODY had a gene that made them slightly more dark with lots of sunlight and slightly less dark with less sunlight - but nobody had a gene than made skin significantly lighter.  But they were able to survive anyways.  Then by raw chance, two different mutations that gave lighter skin happened.  These genes gave an advantage, and so they spread quickly and pretty much everyone on the Eurasian Land mass had the gene.  Now in Africa and Australia it wasn't an advantage so it didn't really spread there.  But note, these genes popped up after people had been living in the northern regions of the UK, Germany, and various parts of Siberia for tens of thousands of years.  Then, by raw chance, a third mutation happened.  Having all 3 was slightly better than having just 2, so this new gene didn't spread all that much.  It stuck around Northern Europe.  Places in southern Europe and Southern Asia, to them having all 3 was actually worse than having just 2, so it didn't spread.  In theory, some of the people living in the arctic circle in Asia probably could have benefited, but either culturally they just so rarely met the peoples that had this new 3rd gene that it never became part of their genome, OR they had enough fish, liver, specialty plant, or other vitamin D sources that it didn't really matter if they had 2 lightening genes, or 3 lightening genes.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 4911.0, "score_ratio": 2.6428571429}

Clearly certain environments like deserts and dry cold regions are better for preserving bodies. However, while we do have some frozen bodies of the Thule to examine there are significantly less than bodies from desert regions. So why? Well there was a 2000 study about a frozen Thule \"mummy\" that addresses this question.   > Although the frigid climate results in mummies frozen with remarkable preservation of outer appearance and microscopic detail, bodies are preserved only under extraordinary circumstances. The frozen ground makes winter burials impossible and the permafrost layer,only a few centimeters below the surface,discourages deep burials even in summer. Cycles of freezing and thawing tend to bring summer burials to the surface,exposing bodies to the ravages of animals and weather.  Burial traditions also play a role in what gets preserved. Many societies adapted to the realities of how difficult it was to bury bodies in frozen ground and simply used surface and platform burials which exposed the bodies much more than burying them does.   >  Platformand surface burials were common in Utqiagvik and other coastal whaling villages until the missionization that accompanied the historic period in the late 1890s. Grave often ac- starting goods companied these burials, typically consisting of personal tools for both men and women. At Pingusugrukon Point Franklin for instance,a woman from a prehistoric whaling village was placed on top of an abandoned kitchen with a skin tool kit that included stone blades and a lump of the red ochre used for trim coloring on parkas and other garments(Sheehanfieldnotes).Also at Pingusugruk, a woman from an earlier Thule settlement was covered by a musk ox skin in the tunnel entrance to an abandoned house (Jensenfieldnotes).  If you're curious, the article was about an autopsy of an 800 year old female child who seemed to have a lung disorder. Lung damage is a common find from communities that sleep and spend their days around fires so her black lungs weren't surprising. But they were damaged much more than they would expect and they suspect a particular lung disorder called AlAT deficiency. Her bones were very osteoporotic, which is common with other ancient Eskimo bodies due to metabolic acidosis from their meat heavy diet. She seemed to have died from starvation and in desperation had eaten dirt, pebbles, and chewed on animal hides (contemporary communities confirmed that when hungry parents often gave their kids animal hides to chew.) But she was a chronically ill child  and this also contributed to her death. She only made it as long as she did because her community cared for her and they suggest this was actually why her body was preserved - it was purposefully buried unlike most bodies.  Families typically stored extra meat by digging a bowl like cache under the house for storage. It was here that she was buried wrapped in a bird skin parka. She was also buried with a toboggan and length of rope, which they suggest might have been how her family transported her. This care resulted in her body being \"the best preserved prehistoric body ever recovered in Alaska.\"   (Just of note - the archaeologists who found her consulted the local Inuit elders who requested that they do an autopsy and treat the body like they would a modern day death. That meant finding out what happened but also handling her with respect and reburying her when finished.)", "human_ref_B": "I'm not qualified to fully answer your question, but I think an important piece of the puzzle is that many of those areas became habitable only \"recently\", and areas where frozen bodies might have been found in the past are no longer covered in permafrost.

Human cognition is a remarkably complex apparatus, so complex that it remains poorly understood in many ways great and small. Far from being surprised that \"things can go wrong\"-- its remarkable that it goes right so much of the time. Human sociobiological evolutionary pressures don't protect us against pathology any more than than it protects against glaucoma. \"Its as good as it can be, considering\".  As just one example: most people can imagine things, but unless dreaming or in an altered state, do not hallucinate. That's a big deal. Very few people who are not profoundly mentally ill or in an altered state of consciousness, will hallucinate - though we all do while sleeping. So that's a pretty remarkable cognitive apparatus- one which is rigorously tuned enough to enable you to dream about your childhood pet in a way that seems very real, and yet to wake up and to understand that that pet has long since passed on to the great Dog Park in the sky. That's a remarkable level of cognitive organization, and its going to be typical of most adults; think of how complex it is.  We can broadly distinguish between two distinct categories -- incapacitating mental illness, which isn't useful in any circumstances, and is ordinarily quite rare- and the much more commonly encountered personality traits which may be appealing and useful in some contexts and not in others. \"Narcissism\" for example, is often a component of social and political charisma, as a matter of degrees it can be energizing and useful to a group; defining it as necessarily and monotonically pathological is overly reductionist. Similarly, there's a continuum between diligence and obsessive compulsive behaviors; you'd prefer a surgeon who was a \"neat freak\", that's not a bad thing, it's a good one. So a lot of negative personality traits are simply dialed up versions of something that at least in some circumstances both the individual and the group they belong to will find useful and/or appealing.  A final note is that the human cognitive capacity grew remarkably quickly -- and that happened on the neurological substrate of a skull and brain that was dramatically reshaped in a relatively short period.

Let me ask you, Why do you think being in an overpopulated place with high levels of human-caused stress in a temperate zone, is preferable to, say, living in northern Alaska?   People came down onto the US Plains states several times, stayed a few generations, or even less, then left again (or all died).

Deserts (which may sound inhospitable to you) were inhabited long before temperate or tropical rainforests were. Coastal areas everywhere, whether hot or cold, are populated before continental interiors. Australia was pretty inhospitable to early travelers, and yet we know they came - apparently with deliberation and a plan.   Small tropical islands can be very inhospitable, but people left some other island and risked a lot to go to a new one. One could say that perhaps it's the same reason some of us move away from home, or out of our parents' houses. We want to. We want something different and new.

From the perspective of prehistoric peoples who settled the north, the autonomy, scarcity of enemies, and relative abundance of game, were certainly important factors in their expansive migrations. Perhaps just as important was the fact that many of these peoples would have been chased away from more central areas after periodic waves of warlordism.  Additionally, the cold may not have been as much of a concern (because they were pretty damn tough back then, and they had like... shelter, clothing, and fire, so NBD), and the end of the ice age meant that formerly desert like areas were lush with vegetation and migratory game.", "labels": 1, "seconds_difference": 2065.0, "score_ratio": 1.4444444444}

If natural does not mean biological, then what does it mean?  God given?  I bet your friend doesn't believe in God creating a list of acceptable behaviors that we all have to follow.

We are also capable of creating unequal societies with low levels of suffering for oppressed groups, and more egalitarian societies where suffering is more or less equally shared.  There is no perfectly egalitarian society (gender and age have always shaped people's status and relationship to the group), but there are societies where everyone gets their basic needs for food, shelter, clothing and companionship met, and where everyone does useful labor and is seen as fully human.

Questions like these have been asked before (vis a vis 'Indo-european migration / Aryan Invasion Hypothesis') and so on, but I still haven't found a definitive answer - is that the case with Historians / Anthropologists everywhere? No one has a definitive answer? Who are the modern Indians descended from? How different are the cultural majority of North Indians from South Indians ('Dravidians')?

On a related note, here's a list of languages by first written account.  My view would be that the IVC, as Indo-European speakers, left the Indus River to move along the Ganges to the delta, situated in modern Bangladesh.  This migration route covers northern India and would likely result in the diffusion of Sanskrit language and the Vedic acculturation of indigenous peoples by way of Hinduism.

This is definitely a touchy subject. Caste and divides between North and South means not only the social status and occupational position that you are born into but your potential marriage pool as well. This would suggest that due to social reasons groups might remain separate genetic populations even when living in the same region. The problem, of course, is that not everyone stays cleanly within their caste when they marry. Hypergamy (marrying up) is quite common for women. Even if you're only marrying slightly up (remember there are many sub-castes within the larger 4 casts plus untouchable group) over a few generations if each daughter marries up you can get those genes into a new caste. And prior to the arrival of the British the caste system was not nearly as formalized or rigid. However, this doesn't stop people from claiming the importance of genetic heritage and the importance of their heritage being distinct and set apart from others. We can see the same thing going on in European royal bloodline debates, for example.   There have been a lot of studies on the genetics of the huge range of culturally diverse communities in India. For example, here is one specifically about the Chenchus and Koyas. It is important to remember that there are over 300 distinct tribal groups in India many with their own languages or dialects. Due in part to simplification for explaining things in intro type courses and the Hindu nationalism within India we sometimes think of India as relatively homogeneous. But there are huge ranges of religion, language, foodways, house types, art forms, and genetics. However, an important point from in the study I just linked is, **\"Studies based on mtDNA have shown that, among Indians, the basic clustering of lineages is not language- or caste-specific.\"** It goes on to say that the population separations that are noted seem to be fairly recent, which makes sense given the historical data we have. This study might be a good one to dispute arguments about how those cultural barriers play out in reality when it comes to sharing genes.   But more to your point about the Aryan-Dravidian divide, there is little genetic evidence. In fact, the genetic evidence suggests it is a load of bs. In fact, Brahmins do not have Central Asian genetic markers that you'd expect if this story line were true.

We're really not that well adapted for life in waist-deep water. On the contrary, we're pretty well adapted for life on the (dry) savannah.", "human_ref_B": "EDIT: So to quick explain AAH, its the theory that the major cause for a ton of our adaptations is that humans were  aquatic apes who became bipedal primarily because of wading into deep water. Depending on who you talk to they will quote different traits, but mainly its hairlessness, diving reflex, webbed fingers, hooded noses etc.  So AAH is a fun hypothesis to throw around at students to make them think, but it also falls short in many many ways and really falls short of pretty much any scrutiny. Water has definitely been a part of human evolution, but nowhere near the level that AAH implies. I'll try and hit a few of the major points of AAH, but if you have any questions please ask.  Point 1: Our relative hairlessness  The thing is that that can more easily be explained by our bipedalism and running abilities. Hair reduces the cooling ability of an animal and our bipedalism is a specialized adaptation to a hot climate. On top of that looking at the biological adaptations we have that deal with bipedalism would have made us worse aquatic animals (we are tall and thin, aquatic animals are short and stout, it deals with heat dissipation and surface area).   On top of that most semi aquatic mammals have a lot of fur. In fact they tend to have the densest, and finest fur of all mammals. The only real exception is Hippos and that deals in their body shape and hydrodynamics (Hippos bones are super dense, and make them sink making fur and air bubbles less likely to help them at any depth, so they compensate with blubber instead of heavy fur though they do still have some fur).   On top of that if you look at semi aquatic mammals they don't have long limbs, that's worse for swimming, and is a horrible adaptation to submersion since it cools the blood in said limbs.   Basically our adaptations are not good for water, but they are great for standing upright in a sunny area.    Point 2: diving reflex, human infants hold their breath automatically when submerged and our heart rate decreased autonomously when our face is wet.  So all mammals that have a womb are born with diving instinct (ironically platypus are the only one that aren't and they are aquatic). Basically its the same feeling as being in the womb so they don't try and breath. It actually disappears quite quickly in humans too. From there any swimming movements should be more seen as an attempt to find traction for movement, not actual swimming.  Point 3: our hooded noses (which prevent water from going into our lungs when upright under water).  So primates can be split into two groups catarrhine (old world monkeys); and Platyrrhini (New world monkeys). All old world monkeys have noses that face down and hooded nostrils. The question of how far down they face is dependent on how defined their nose is from their snout. In humans that deals primarily with the reduction of the honing canine, but all great apes have hooded nostrils.  Point 4: minor webbing of our fingers  We have no more or less \"webbing\" than any of the other great apes.  Point 5: Prune finger reflex (which increases grip underwater)  Well a few things. First off all primates fingers prune up when exposed to water long term. Second it doesn't REALLY increase grip underwater. Every study done doesn't show any real advantage by comparison of pruney fingers to non pruney fingers in dexterity, feeling, or grip. Truth is we aren't exactly sure why they prune up, that's just an explanation that got proposed in 2011 and has kinda stuck in pop science explanations.  AAH is fun to think about, and humans absolutely swam and used aquatic resources earlier than we think about. But it was most likely not a driving force behind our evolutionary traits.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 1271.0, "score_ratio": 16.8333333333}

An easy example is the sacredness of cows in India.  Harris came to the conclusion that this was a practice that evolved from the underlying usefulness of cows in that particular area of the world.  A well-kept cow provides milk, yogurt calves, plowing of fields, manure for fertilization... many benefits beyond that of beef meat.  As such, it became ingrained in culture that cows were not for eating.  In essence, beliefs have a function.  Otherwise they don't stick around.  Obviously Ancient Egyptian religion (from around 5000 years ago)  has not provided that function, and therefore has not persisted.  The predominant religion in the world, Christianity, has been around for 2000 years, has probably provided the world with some function during that time, or else it would no longer exist; it is, however, shrinking.  Hinduism is upwards of 3500 years old; Buddhism around 2500.  Currently the fastest growing religions are Islam and atheistic/none.  One has to assume that each of these has a specific function, and that people are drawn to them based on their need at that point in time.   Religious beliefs as a whole exist far beyond recorded history.  So to answer your question: if there is a function of religion in ensuring the mental health of a given group of humans, it will continue to exist.  I see our future plagued with a number of uncertainties in the future, and religion is most effective when used to account for factors beyond our control.  We likely will have an impending refugee crisis in the near future as climate change forces demographic movements like nothing we've ever seen; I'd predict religion to be present through that.  Should we make it to a space age -- as I would hope -- then I have no doubt that careful scientific knowledge and atheism will be very prevalent; I wouldn't be surprised if new religions arrive to fill the new gaps in knowledge that we will inevitable have.  We have yet to figure out whether or not we'll be around as a species for the next 200 years.  I'm more worried about that.

First of all, the modern people who call themselves Assyrian, Chaldean, Syriac, and Aramean all belong to the same ethnoreligious group, sometimes called \"Syriac-speaking Christians,\" since they speak dialects of Neo-Aramaic, a modern form of Syriac.

Arameans and Syriacs belong to the Syriac Orthodox Church, also known as the \"Jacobite\" Church. Yet, they are all the same people, and the most commonly accepted label is the Assyrian one.  The conflict between the people who identify and Assyrian and the people who identify as Aramean has severely divided this community. \"Arameans\" are almost always members of the Syriac Orthodox Church. However, \"Assyrians\" are found in all three churches, though, of course, they have the strongest presence in the Assyrian Church of the East.

Modern Assyrians believe that they descend from the Neo-Assyrian Empire in northern Mesopotamia. This has caused an intense debate on the true origins and identity of the modern Assyrians.

You can skip all that nonsense and use regular AP with 3tsp of baking powder to every 225g of flour. Done.  Salt \\*can\\* interfere with leavening.  Turbinado sugar is BAD (for this. I love it as a sprinkle on top of muffins and stuff before baking. It's more of a garnish or topping than an ingredient.)  It's probably the bulk of your problem.  Next time use CASTER sugar which in the USA is usually called \"Fine Granulated\"  There's chemistry science behind this that involve what happens when you cream it with the sugar. The whole point of which is to get as much air in it as you can and the grain size of caster allows this to happen best.  If you're using a stand mixer set a timer for \\~5 minutes and use the paddle on med-high. It's done when the butter turns from yellow-ish to white and if you rub it between your fingers,  you don't feel a LOT of grains of sugar. (you'll feel some.) Just getting it all the way pale, if you're using caster is enough.  Eggs should be room temp. If your recipe called for cold, I don't know why. It's wrong. Also, don't beat the eggs first. Have a little bowl where you're working and crack the egg one at  a time  into that (just in case so you don't have to fish shells out of the batter if that happens) and then add it to the batter.  So with the butter and sugar creamed, add 1 egg at a time and let the mixer go for 20-30 seconds in between each egg on medium medium-low speed. you're not really trying to add any air at this point you just want to evenly get the eggs emulsified into the batter.  Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the SIFTED flour into the mixture. Be **patient** and gentle. Do. Not. Rush. This. This is a good time to get kids involved. They can hold the sieve and shake the flour into the batter for you while you fold.  I sometimes have cake-batter-hunting children around when I bake.  Line your tins with parchment with tabs that will make lifting the cake out easy and carefully fill the tin. Gently level the top of the batter. Use a spatula or something, don't bang the tin on the counter to settle it b/c that will literally settle-out the air. No need to be fussy about it though, just generally level is fine.

Turbadino sugar is coarse & isn't suitable for creaming, but you can substitute if a recipe doesn't require creaming.   How did you measure your flour? If you scooped it, you ended up compacting the flour & adding more flour without realizing it. Also overmixing flour produces more gluten which can end up with more touch finished product. You can try cake flour next time if you choose too, see if it makes a difference. Also cake flour weighs less per cup than AP flour does.  Your eggs & butter should be at room temp before you start. It helps by incorporating the ingredients better, as warmish things combine better than cold. There's no need to beat the eggs like crazy than add to sugar mixture. I have a digital meat thermometer I take the temp of my butter before I start. I usually start when it reaches 68-72\u00b0F, as you cream/beat butter the temp will warm up alittle depending on how warm the kitchen is.  With pound cake, cream butter with sugar for about 3-4 mins, add eggs one at a time, when all the eggs are added then add flour until just combined. Then bake until it's ready.

There are high production bakeries where you bake items in bulk with a focus on product consistency, or smaller artisan bakeries where you will still be doing production, but on a much smaller scale with a little more creative freedom. Either way, professional baking is fast paced, physically demanding, and you most likely will not be able to develop any of your own recipes, or have a lot of creative input.   I don't want to discourage anyone from stepping into the industry, but a lot of home bakers have very specific ideas of what working in an actual bakery is like and I just want to temper your expectations. My suggestion would be to stage at a few local bakeries for a full shift and see what a typical day would look like on the job. Send out a lot of stage requests, since most places will be looking for some prior experience, and you may get just a few responses. If you like it, you can either apply directly, or use it to inform your area of study if you want to attend pastry school.

What they do have is high volume and pressure to perform. My biggest concern with hiring someone with no experience is not the actual baking (that's as skill that can be taught to the majority of people) - it's getting someone with either no work ethic or simply no idea that yes, this means up at 3am. Yes, this means on your feet for 8-12 hours a day. No, you can't take a lunch now because the oven is full and your bread needs you.   It's the same idea behind starting as a dishwasher in a restaurant. Surviving a Saturday night dish shift doesn't mean you can cook, it means you can do the physical work. Surviving Thanksgiving in a grocery store means you won't break if you come in to a dozen wedding cakes.  You can take classes if you want. Generally experience is rated higher than education *but* baking is a little different because there are usually fewer bakers on staff - as little as one and a backup. That means less time and money to pay for an apprentice. If you have a community college near you, check for baking classes. Those will be more affordable and fill you in on basics and familiarize you with the equipment you'll be using. Going in with a base knowledge won't hurt you and if you also get a job at a chain bakery, in a couple of years you'll have enough experience for a more boutique spot.  Baking is also a very wide range - bread baking, patisserie, general baker, and cake decorating are all very different skill sets and most bakers can do a range but specialize in one or two. Working in a big bakery can help you figure out which you prefer. For me, I like decorating occasional cakes but working as a decorator just means you come home so sticky with icing.

For e.g. working on an enriched dough, my dough has failed twice and I really don't understand how fast to run it for how long.  For Brian Lagerstrom's pretzel dough I stirred for 3 minutes. Speed 2 till it came together (2 mins) and then started adding butter in tsp. It was a mess so I went hey, let's run it faster to give it strength. Ran it at 4 and it was downhill the whole time. Result was an overkneaded porridge. Ive failed cinnamon rolls, brioche and this pretzel dough and now I'm convinced I don't know how to use this machine and need help. I am yet to experience this \"dough slapping across the bowl\" i see in every youtube video because of this.  The one solution outside of this I'll try is being super anal about butter temp and forgoing AP flour completely.

As you are learning to use the mixer, I recommend stopping every minute and checking your gluten development to get a sense of where the dough is at and what has changed. To me, this is a much more accurate metric than whether it slaps around the bowl or balls up on the hook - that doesn't always happen.  Lastly, if your doughs are coming out wet - are you adjusting for flour that you would have added when kneading by hand?

I've built a starter following Ken Forkish's instructions in FWSY (scaled down to reduce waste), and it is 3 or so weeks old. The last two loaves I've baked were the overnight country blonde from FWSY, both of which did not rise much during bulk fermentation (with the second loaf rising the most and growing ~1.5x). Forkish calls for an overnight bulk ferment, and waiting until the dough grows 2-3x in size, which I am not achieving. By the time I try to shape the rounds the next morning, they remain sticky and don't hold their shape. When they go in the dutch oven, they simply spread out as much as they can, and get little to no oven spring, leaving me with a dense round with a tacky, almost sticky crumb that looks as though it's cooked through.

The rattling sound is very distinct here. In the rest of the video I do a 3-point turn and keep driving in 2nd and 3rd gear for a while, where the rattling sound is also hearable when I shift gears.  Does anyone know what this rattling stems from? I've noticed other Skoda Octavias not having this sound at all - they all sound very quiet and refined, and do not emit this rattling sound.

Also when elaborate table settings came into vogue and why people now eat with cutlery from the outside in. Still piling crap onto a plate, but with charger plates.

I'm considering a refinement to my reverse-sear method, please advise me. This is inspired by the Serious Eats reverse sear method of cooking prime rib:  I have a 4.6lb boneless prime rib roast (chuck end, I believe). Last night I rubbed it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and it's been sitting uncovered in the refrigerator overnight. I intend to reverse sear it, first low and slow at 235F for 4-6 hours (or whatever it takes to get to 132F), rest it for 20-30m, then blast it at 500F for 5-10 minutes (or whatever it takes to crust it. I've done this method in the past without tenting, and I was very happy with the results.  But while rubbing with SPGp, a bunch fell off into the pan. Of course that'll burn if left dry in the pan. So I though about adding beef broth for the low and slow part of the cook. Then I thought about tenting it to keep the liquid from evaporating too quickly.  I'm thinking the tenting might give me additional flavor in the jus, and maybe make the roast more fall-apart juicy and tender.  At the end of the slow cook, I'd remove the roast from the oven to rest for 20-30m. I'd strain off the pan juices (if any) and mix with the deli-provided au jus. Then I'd blast at 500F, carve and serve.  I have questions:  * Am I thinking right about getting better results by tenting and essentially 'steaming' it? * How will steaming affect the duration of the cook? It should go much quicker, right? * How will the 'steaming' affect the final crusting? Will I be able to achieve that crust at the end? * I'm wondering if removing the tent part-way through to pour off the juices, remove the roast from the oven, taking the time to empty the pan and wipe it out, then putting the roast back in to finish the slow part of the cook is a wrong move that could cause the meat to toughen. Should I do this at the very end? Or earlier than that to dry the crust a bit? Am I overthinking this? * I'd like to add rosemary and thyme to the crust, but of course they'll burn at the end. When is a good time to rub with herbs? Beginning? Early? Late? Never? It's too late to do it last night. * I heard of somebody also rubbing with brown sugar to help the crust, is this a thing?

I spend 7 months in Japan for an internship, and during my time there, one of the things I did was to nerd out on the subject of japanese knifes.   First of all, japanese chefs often prefer carbon steel knives because of its superior edge holding ability and ease of sharpening compared to stainless steel. One side effect of this is that the knives rust. Leaving a knife to rust will cause discoloration. The patina is not a big issue - for many western chefs, a dark patina is considered a proof of their hard work. While the patina is not an issue, leaving a knife wet also causes the edge to rust - meaning your knife will become dull if not properly cared for.   The best and only way to prevent your knife from rusting is to wipe it when it's not in use. Even if you're just gonna leave your knife for 10-15 minutes, wipe it dry. Not \"kinda dry\", really dry. Keep a towel only for keeping your knife dry.   When I say dry, one salesman in tokyo told me to dry the knife with a hairdryer at the end of each day. While this is not necessary, it says alot of how important it is to keep your knife dry.   Also, to keep your knife clean, don't use tough sponges that might wear on the edge, use soft ones or towels together with some plain soap.   Another thing that helps you keep your knife sharp is a good sharpening steel. A common misconception is that a sharpening steel actually makes your edge sharper. It doesn't. It just re-aligns the edge after it's been slightly bent after a days work, so the edge can \"attack\" the food from the right angle.   To keep your knife deadly sharp, invest in a sharpening stone. There are different \"grains\" on sharpening stone, and generally, the lower the number is the rougher the grain is. For everyday sharpening, I recommend a 1000-grain stone and a 6000-grain stone to finish the edge. while a 1000-grain stone is enough for most people, the 6000-grain gives your edge that last bit of polish that is needed for working with sushi.   While I hate the Global-brand more than anything, it's ridiculously overpriced, and not that good to start off with, they do have a great video where a japanese chef shows you how to sharpen your knife with a stone. It's truly a great tutorial, it takes alot of practice but when you get it right, you can make your knife sharper than any professional knife shop with just a couple of minutes work.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIw5ChGOADE  If you want get yourself a real, expensive yanagiba, I reccomend you get a knife from the tokyo-branch of Aritsugu. The aritsugu family has been in the sword&knife-making business since the fifteen hundreds, and this shop is where most people go from the Tokyo Tsukuji Fish Market to get knives and I've had several japanese sushi chefs recommend me this brand. The prices of their knifes aren't too bad, I got myself an incredible Aritsugu A-style 24 cm Wa-gyuoto (chefs knife) for about 150 dollars. Check it out at:  http://aritsugu.jp/   A site I learned alot from is Z-knives. That guy goes ridicously in depth in this knife reviews and even tests and compares steels used in different knives. It's a great read.   http://zknives.com/knives/kitchen/ktknv/indexall.shtml  If you have any more questions about caring for your knifes or buying new knives, I'll be happy to answer any questions.", "human_ref_B": "I am a left handed sushi chef too!

I never used butter just some good high heat oil, you don't need a ton of oil just enough to get a good coat with maybe a little extra. Let it get quite literally smoking hot. Once you are at this point toss those onions in and let it cook for a second before you start moving it. The main ideas here are a few things, first don't overload your pan if you put to much what you basically do is steam your onions with the moisture that is released. Second let the damn things cook you don't have to be constantly moving them, you want some color to develop and those natural sugars to start to release in the liquid (hence caramelization). After about 10-15 minutes (less for smaller batches) of stirring and you should have some really good color starting and your onions should be cooked. Here's where it gets tempting to dump it out but DON'T you see all that nice dark color on the bottom of the pan that's the sweet sugary goodness you want. Turn off the head and cover with a tight lid for about 5-10 minutes, the moisture still being released will condense on your lid, and drip down deglazing all that sugar, give it a good stir to get all that fond off and BOOM heaven made from onions, easy as pie.  Main point is let them onion cook, if you are constantly stirring all you are doing is just letting your pan cool and no real color develop. If you do overload the pan, there's a fix for that but it is a bit more difficult and basically involves a controlled burning, in that you let the onions on the bottom cook through and start to darken then stir. Then let that layer darken, then stir, repeat till color is achieved that like before, a good tight fitting lid and take it off heat  edit: the reason I don't use butter is typical store bought butter had \"solids\" and filler in it that are going to burn and it has a relatively low heat tolerance", "human_ref_B": "Are you cooking just until soft, or are you cooking them for a full 45 minutes until they are caramelized?

When you ordered your taco's, they'd grab a hunk of meat, cut off a chunk, and start cooking it on the raised dome of the sombrero pan.  That part was significantly hotter than the oil bath.  While they did that, they threw silver dollar sized corn tortillas into the oil, then when the meat was done they chopped it up finely(all on the dome mind you) then they'd pull the tortilla out of the oil, fry them on the dome for a few seconds on each side.  They do two tortillas per taco, fill with meat and shredded cabbage(never seen lettuce in Mexico), onions, tomatoes, etc...  I'd just get the meat.

Without any other info I would guess the meat was probably pork (shoulder most likely) and it was cooked in Mexican lard, but the same can also be done with duck, goose, rabbit, beef which I would imagine would be incredibly rich, more so than duck. There is another classic French technique called rillete, which is basically the same technique. It consists of curing pork shoulder with spices and prague powder #1, poaching it in lard and wine at a low temp for a very long time, cooling it, separating the meat from the fat, and then re-emulsifying some of the fat and juice back into the meat, and molding it.   edit: forgot to mention the distinction between American lard and Mexican lard. As I understand it from one of my former chefs who has spent a good deal of time in Mexico, they render their pork fat at a higher temperature, which causes a good deal of maillard reaction, which gives Mexican lard a brownish color and a smoky, meaty flavor.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 8283.0, "score_ratio": 1.1666666667}

To make it tender, you need to literally melt the collagen, which turns it into gelatin. This requires a low level of heat for a very long period of time (think hours) in the presence of moisture.

We have seen some absolutely amazing gastronomic discussions here, and hope you continue to provide the community with such helpful and thoughtful conversations.  With the rate of growth we have had the past few months, we feel it is necessary to make a few changes, reiterate some points and get the communities feedback on a few issues. The goal of these potential changes is to provide everyone with a better experience in our community. **We want to hear all of your feedback on these issues.**  Our main concern is about some of the questions that are being submitted.  * **Recipe based question**s - If you refer to our current rule #5 located in our sidebar, you can see that not every recipe based question is encouraged here. **We are not Google.** If you simply need ideas for a piece of meat, or want to know a great pie recipe, you will most likely get many great answers through google, or even other sub reddits. /r/cooking, /r/food or /r/recipes are all options. However, we understand there are some recipe based questions that are more uncommon, and harder to find legit answers, and in that case, you may post here. Think of /r/askculinary as the last resort. Questions like [this, this and this are not desirable here. Questions like this and this are fine however. Notice the difference in the quality of the question. The OP provides much more background and information in the posts that are well written. The more specific you can make a recipe/ingredient based question, the better.  * **Discussion based questions** - This sub reddit and community was created to help people become a better cook, and to increase your culinary knowledge. If a post has little to do with cooking, and would not help others with the answers, we feel this is not accomplishing our original goal. Questions like these three(#1, #2, #3) are not very appropriate here. Perhaps /r/KitchenConfidential is better. That being said, posts like this and this, are completely fine. Basically, if the answers to the question being asked would help the community in their culinary adventures, it is fine. **If it is just to share war stories and what not, we feel these do not fit in here.**  * **Question and comment formatting** - **With every question you ask, please be sure to give as much detail as possible.** The more detail you can give us, the better we can help you. Conversely, the more through you can be in your responses and comments, the better. Try to avoid those one or two word comments, make it as thorough as you can. We are aware that this is not always possible or necessary, but try and make your posts as thoughtful as possible. Good post, not so good post.

I use mine about once or twice a week, or at the very least, once every two weeks.

I use it probably about as often as I use an oven, so logically it is a good investment.

As the title said, my nephew died unexpectedly 16 days ago, and we have no idea how. We are still waiting for the autopsy report, but our family is obviously grieving and the uncertainty is killing us. Therefore im turning to you, in order order for, even if it's very little, information. I will do my best in explaining the whole situation. Im also an CRNA and therefore have some medical knowledge.   My nephew was a typical teenager. Just finished high school, didn't have a job yet. Was up all night gaming and sleeping all day. Had alot of friends, was a very kind-hearted person. Had no known medical issues apart from being born pre-mature and having ADD. According to his little sister and some friends, after the incident, he occasionally took Lyrica as recreational drug use, but very certain that there was no other drugs.   The night he died he hung out with two friends. The friend suspected that he had taken Lyrica before arriving at their place, but that he got more normal as the night progressed. All they did was playing video games and watching movies. At 5 in the morning my nephew texted his little sister that he was coming home at around 11-12 and then they all went to bed (all three slept in the same bed).   At 11 the friend's father enters the room and finds my nephew on the floor stone-cold dead. Probably been dead for a few hours. Anyway they all freaked out and started CPR and called 911. When help arrived they worked on him for about 30 minutes before going to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.  About a week later I called the pathology lab asking if there was any information. I didn't talk to a doctor but the person read from some report that there were no structural causes for the sudden death. Heart was normal, no ruptures etc. The lungs were abit enlarged and that the brain weighed too much (cerebral edema?). They have taken samples and biopsies that's been sent away for analyzing.   We're at a loss here... I have two scenarios in my head. First, he just died. Sudden cardiac death without structural cause (cardiomyopathy etc), maybe caused by some recreational drug. Second, he OD'd on opiates and fell out of bed and stopped breathing. This however feels so out of character for him. It also seem strange to take something just before going to bed.

I was going around 45 mph and slammed into a concrete electrical pole. This was a DUI crash and a huge wake-up call for me and the direction my life was going. It's really a case of I shouldn't be alive and I'm grateful to even be here making this post.  It feels like because of my circumstances my doctor doesn't have as much compassion for me as his other patients (I've heard him talking to other patients in the room next to mine at my appointments and his demeanor seems to be much more caring for them.) The appointments have not been more than 5-10 minutes with the doc. My first appointment was 3 weeks after the surgery and his advice to me was \"use crutches and don't fuck it up\".  His words not mine. His assistant had been talking to me earlier and said \"you probably won't need physical therapy\" and no mention about PT from the doc, just \"don't fuck it up. Fast forward a month later to last week, the first thing the doctor and assistant ask is \"how's therapy been\". I didn't even know I was supposed to be going? I told them I hadn't gone but I showed him that I was able to walk and bear weight without crutches but my leg would collapse if I wasn't stiffening out my knee. He then checked my knee and ordered an MRI and said \"yea with these types of injuries its common to injure the knee as well\". I got my MRI done 2 days ago and will be back to see the doc next week with my MRI results. If this is so common, why didn't they check for this earlier?  As far as the femur goes, he told me that it's just about looking healed. How is that possible? I still feel pain when I move my leg in certain ways, mostly in the inside of my thigh where the bone has split. It feels like the end of it is poking the inside of my leg. To me it doesn't look like it has healed much at all to me so that's why I'm here trying to get some second opinions.

My mom (61 f) who has been battling stage 4 breast cancer since 2015, was told 4 weeks ago her liver wasn\u2019t responding to the chemo and the tumors were increasingly growing. They quickly changed to a new chemo in hopes that it responds well to the liver tumors- but no luck. The bilirubin numbers were high, starting at 2.1, then 4.9 a a week later, and a 11.2 the following week. I was told there is nothing else we can do. No more chemo, no radiation. Her liver is failing. I asked about clinical trials, liver transplant, and immunotherapy- all which I was told she doesn\u2019t qualify for due to the Mets spread to her bones, lungs and brain as well. She had brain surgery a year ago to remove a tumor and was told she had leptomeningeal disease. But that improved with intrathecal injections + cyber knife radiation.    Hospice was the only option other than taking her home regularly with a home health aide. Which was not enough support in my opinion with her current state.

I was being late to school because id spend so much time straining in the morning. I told my parents that week that i hadnt been able to poop all week and they made me a black coffee with coconut oil. it kind of helped, but the constipation continued despite no change in my life style.  I was taken to the doctor around december and even though i was drinking plenty of water, i had a smoothie before the appointment so my pee was more yellow than usual, and the doctor just rubbed it off as me needing to drink more water.  (2020) I continued for about a year only pooping once a week, and needing a laxative to do so. I started getting extremely bloated and not wanting to eat or even drink water because i felt so full and it hurt.  I ended up waking up one day extremely nauceous and threw up, and i threw everything since my lunch from the previous day completely undigested.  This cycle continued where id be constipated all week, get sick and throw up undigested food at the end and use a laxative as an emergency. I was taken to the doctor again and she told me I need to eat more (even though I was eating a normal amount, a pretty equal and balanced diet actually)  I was at my massage therapist and told her about my issues and that it hurt to lay on my stomach, she started feeling my stomach and gut and told me that she felt some sort of mass in my gut and tried to gently massage it, but told me to go to the doctor and demand answers.  (2021) I was taken to the doctor and this one actually listened, she had me do an x ray and they found that I was full of poop, pushing on my organs, making me llook bigger, and pushing on my lungs as well, all the way up to my lungs was poop build up. The doctor was extremely bothered that none of the doctors before me paid attention to my complaints and said this was extremely dangerous. They said it seemed like my digestive system wasnt working properly/failed  They planned another visit for me to have testing done, but till then had me to a colonoscopy prep(for 7 days) to empty my bowls so that the medical risk went down. I was so excited to finally get relief  Nothing happened  About 3 days in of taking 7 laxatives a day i got a little but of diareah, but it was like it was leaking around it and not actually emptying it out. It was a normal amount.  When i finally got the test done, they said that my bowel muscles seemed to be working fine and that they wernt sure what was wrong, they told me to not eat much and try to drink mainly liquids till they could figure out the problem, but they just never followed up?? So eventually i started eating normal again.  Ive since moved and am not with my parents doctor anymore, but the constipation has only gotten worse. Everytime i poop i need to strain so hard and almost always bleed feel my anus tearing no matter how small it is. Sometimes 1 tiny circle poop comes out and abunch of blood and blood clots/clumps is a majority of whats in the toilet and it gets everywhere.  Another thing i noticed is that the non tiny poops/normal ones are extremely too big for the hole, and almost flat, so the hole cant gradually expand to let it out, like a cone shape. If the hole is 1 inch open the base of the poop is 2 1/2 inches or more.  pooping makes my body so sore and shakey and it covers the toilet and my hands in blood.

It seems like episodes are less likely to happen in situations where I am anxious. I'm thinking that has something to do with raised blood pressure. There are more symptoms which I listed out in my second post.  **Since my last post**:  * I had a neurologist that decided I have conversion disorder after he couldn't find anything else wrong  * I decided it was worth it to wait for a top neurologist to see me. That neuro did not think it was psychiatric.  * That neuro decided to send me to a Thoracic Surgeon to test for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome for the 4th time because he said that he knew one person who would perform the test and would produce reliable results since most people don't properly test for it.  These were his thoughts:  > It sounds like a vascular issue to me. Thoracic outlet is certainly in the nix and we will test it by ultrasound 01:12 . If negative, we will do a tilt-table to look for dysautonomia and then finally may look at the cervical occipital instability. She had a flexion and extension MRI that showed some findings, but we may need to get her to see a local neurosurgeon who has an expertise on that. I doubt she is having epilepsy.  * Test for TOS came back positive, meaning 2/4 prelim. tests I have done for TOS have come back positive  * Did more tests  **Diagnosis**: Suggestive of mild-moderate venous thoracic outlet syndrome on the right and equivocal mild venous thoracic outlet syndrome on the left.  They also found a small hyper enhancing lesion on my liver which they are going to do an MRI of later, but it is most likely just a benign flash-filling hemangioma so I'm not worried about it.  So now that **I have a diagnosis** you may be wondering, **what is the problem?**   #**My diagnosis doesn't fit all my symptoms**  Specifically, my problems with lapses in consciousness.   I wanted to hear your thoughts on what underlying 2nd condition there may be if there is one.  I recorded some videos where I induce episodes. I accidentally hit my head in two of the videos, but I didn't know that I did until I watched the videos. I also had some memory loss of immediately before and after each episode.   Note that these episodes are what I was classify as mild-moderate. I frequently have more severe ones but they only really get severe when they catch me off guard.  In each video you will note there is a lag between when I turn my head and the visible symptoms occur.

I have a question about my wife, she doesnt use reddit, so I wanted to ask for her.  My wife (29F) is about 5'7\" and 165lbs.  She's had 3 kids, the youngest being 2 and the oldest being 7.  She has an incrediblely difficult time losing weight.  She is by no means what I consider overweight, but she wants to lose weight, and there is weight to lose.  We have a Peloton bike and she uses it about an hour every day along with strength trainings 3-4 times a week.  She has been doing the OMAD (One Meal a Day) diet for over a month and she has not been able to lose any weight.  She has been on various workout regimes and diets for a couple of years with no noticeable effects.  Its tough for me to watch since she tries so so hard, adheres to very strick diets, works out like nobody else I've ever seen and she still can't lose any weight.  I feel like if anyone else was doing what she does they'd be losing tons of weight.  Whenever I do her diets and workouts I end up losing weight so fast.  She also suffers from depression.  She takes a low dose of FLUoxetine (10mg a day), and her struggles with losing weight usually put her in a bout of depression a few times a week. She also gets depressed easily about other things, but most of the time it is from her not losing weight.  When she is depressed she has a hard time being motivated to do anything and she talks about how much she hates herself.  I do feel like it is depression rather than just being bummed.  She is also very sensitive to foods and sugar. If she eats something sugary on an empty stomach, she gets sick to her stomache. She can't drink soda because it makes her sick, and just overall has a very sensitive stomach.  She had a really hard time with the OMAD diet when she started because she would would feel sick to her stomach if she hadn't eaten, but she says it's not bad anymore.  We were sure she had hyperthyroidism since the symptoms seemed to fall in line with that.  We went to our pcp and they did the tests for hyperthyroidism and she also tested her for diabetes.  We got the test results tonight and they all came back in the normal range, so she doesnt have hyperthyroidism or diabetes. This put her in a depressed mood because she feels like she just isn't doing enough to lose weight and she was so sure this was the issue.   I have a hard time believing that there isnt something wrong with her body and I just feel like there is an underlying issue. My wife doesn't want to go back to the pcp since she is so embarrassed by this. I wanted to get all of your thoughts and see if you have seen anything similar.  I really just want my wife back, her depression has taken a big toll on me and I struggle seeing her so down on herself all the time and there is nothing I do or say that helps.

{"post_id": "x0un63", "domain": "askdocs_test", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "history": "Why was my wife's pain treated so inadequately after surgery? My (41M) wife (38F) recently had abdominal surgery. I arrived back at the hospital to find her basically overwhelmed with pain the morning after the surgery. She had had no pain relievers administered in almost 11 hours.  She was sobbing, writhing, shaking, with blood pressure 50 points higher than normal. They hadn't given her any opioids overnight, nor had they given her tylenol or NSAIDS.  My limited understanding of pain relief after surgery is that you stay ahead of the pain. You don't let it become overwhelming for the patient. We are trying to figure why this happened, particularly so we can prevent it from happening again. She was semi-traumatized from the experience.  My wife has no history of opioid abuse and in fact has a history of using opioids briefly after other surgeries and then getting off of them quickly with no issue, so opioid abuse should not have been a concern preventing my wife from getting proper care.  What we did figure out is that the process that was in place for pain relievers at this hospital was that my wife was supposed to be asking for them, or they were not going to be given. The nurses kept saying that pain relief was \"PRN\". However neither my wife nor I were ever informed that she would need to be doing the asking or would get nothing for pain and with major abdominal surgery, we had both assumed that the doctors and nurses would be providing for her pain relief so soon after surgery. She did not know to ask and did not realize that she would be absolutely slammed with pain so soon after waking the morning after surgery.  Further, the process in the hospital even after asking for pain relief is that it takes about an hour for the medication to be approved and provided. Even after the oral medication was provided, it would take another hour to become active for her symptoms. So we're talking even after my wife is begging for pain medicine, not knowing she should have to, she would be in growing pain for another two hours.  By the time an oral medication was approved the morning after, my wife was afraid she was gasping and sobbing so hard it would not even be safe for her to attempt swallowing anything and requested an IV pain reliever, but this was initially denied. The nurses told her that she was in this much pain because hadn't peed and she would feel better if she walked and got up to pee, but being up and attempting to walk only increased her pain.  Eventually the doctor arrived to check in and was completely appalled at the state that my wife was in and ordered the IV opioid pain relief. He said that she had been undertreated for pain. In short order after IV opioids, my wife was okay, walking, conversing, peeing and sitting up.  We are left with questions about why this happened. This is a hospital with a good reputation in a major metropolitan area. Do I need to just plan on being with my wife every second if she has any future surgeries so that I can protect her? Should we just avoid this hospital? Is the way that pain relief was provided related to systemic concerns about preventing opioid addiction that we might encounter in other hospitals as well? Why on earth would pain medication be PRN so soon after abdominal surgery and why would no one tell us? Why didn't they at least provide some ibuprofen on a schedule? How can we prevent this from happening in the future and is there any particular person at the hospital we can talk to communicate that how they handled this was highly problematic and is likely to be highly problematic for other patients as well?", "c_root_id_A": "imdtyfc", "c_root_id_B": "imdt2kt", "created_at_utc_A": 1661866083, "created_at_utc_B": 1661865682, "score_A": 15, "score_B": 14, "human_ref_A": "I am sorry this happened to your wife.

If she *did* communicate the pain, at that point the nurse fell through for not asking if she would like her PRN pain meds at that time.  The reason strong pain meds are rarely given regularly without a patient having to ask, or while a patient  sleeps, is because this is dangerous and you risk over sedating the patient.

{"post_id": "kj9kkm", "domain": "askengineers_test", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "history": "My boss canceled our holiday break because I asked when a good time would be to take my vacation days, feeling down about my chances of having a career in our (small, incestuous) field I'm a metallurgical engineer at a forensic engineering firm in Canada. I've been in the doghouse since July since my boss, the business owner, found out that I was working 8+ hours/day but not always taking my full (unpaid) lunch hour and leaving early. My coworkers all work varying hours and it was stressed to me that flexibility was normal and expected, but what I was doing was apparently a huge trespass on my boss's generosity and taking advantage of him. I am paid a salary.  This month I asked when a good time would be to take my remaining vacation days and didn't hear back, and we got busy anyway. As the month drew down and it looked like we were going to close over christmas/new years anyway, I asked if I should request for my vacation days to be held over since there wouldn't be an opportunity to take them. My boss called me into a meeting this week with the other engineers where he announced that he'd changed company policy to forbid holding over vacation days and had cancelled the holiday break, so anyone with remaining vacation days could use them next week. The technicians don't get vacation days and are required to come in.  He told everyone about my nefarious scheme to get extra holidays by holding over my vacation time to next year, and that was taking advantage of him and was damaging to the business, because who would cover in terms of cash and manpower if he was forced to allow employees to take vacation time that had... already been allocated...  The good news is that I got a recording (Canada is one-party consent) that's now on multiple cloud services of him describing how he didn't plan on following our province's employment laws regarding vacation time, and stating that canceling winter break was to retaliate against me for requesting the vacation time offered to me in my employee contract, but in the end I'm feeling really down about this.  Trying to work here has been a drain on my sanity and health, and I've been looking for other employment basically since about 6 months in, but the recruiter calls dried up with COVID. I'm thinking of an interview I had with another forensic engineering firm where they said that their engineers had to handle 20+ active investigations, and that they knew my boss, and I just feel defeated.   I've got a massive industrial investigation going right now and a handful of insurance ones, and the workload is so heavy. I do my own labwork and my boss yells at me if I pass too much to the technicians. I read more papers every few months than I did for my whole masters. We've skirted COVID restrictions so I've still been in the office every day. I have no short term memory and took on 3 prescriptions to try to control all my stress-related illnesses.  How can I manage 20 files and take on full responsibility for the conclusions instead of filtering it through my boss? He shows me all the bad forensic reports that he tears to shreds and tells me about other young engineers who were run out of the industry, and how bad it is at other firms. Yeah, he's doing that to control me, but maybe that is how it is.  Everybody seems to know everybody in this field, and my boss will just tell all his contacts how I screwed him over unfairly. I want to solve these forensic mysteries and help clients, but that might mean letting my boss do what he wants, because I need the experience and references. I'm going to go for a consultation with an employment lawyer, but I'm discouraged because the legal remedy may be at best a small financial payout + getting blacklisted in the industry.  I also keep trying to compose something to send my boss to try to keep the peace until he finally fires me, but it keeps turning into \"hey taintmonger, vacation time per year is guaranteed by law and not something you get to bestow on or snatch away from your employees\".  This a \"woe is me\" post but I'm looking for some perspective from other engineers, which might be \"STFU at least you have a job right now\".

A decade out, I've come to notice that the people who progress faster in their career are the ones who have this sixth sense for career growth, when it's time to move, what industries are hot, and things like that. We've all seen examples of someone clearly disconnected from that sixth sense - \"I'm an EE doing embedded systems for 10 years making $65k, is that good\"? And I think I'm aware enough to know ballpark numbers of what's reasonable. But I'm interested in the people who seem to be experts at it.  Both on this sub, and in real life networking, I'll hear phrases like \"Check out Parker Hannifin, they can't hire people fast enough!\" or \"Try Boeing's electronics division, starting salary $130k, minimum\" or \"my buddy tells me 3M is starting a new location in Pennsylvania, they're desperate for people, I heard numbers like $120k being thrown around\" or \"with your experience, you should be getting $150k at least\".  These phrases are usually worded and said with the utmost confidence. And I've always wondered, where do these people get all this information? I thought the general conclusion was that Glassdoor lowballs salaries, just because it doesn't update for inflation or new market conditions. If they're talking with a friend or professional contact who's an engineer, without being the manager or the one hiring, it's very likely that they don't have the full context of what the personnel ramp up or salary range is. In the end, it seems like these confident proclamations essentially come down to anecdotal hearsay.  I did listen to a connection who told me that ASML was ramping up and that it would be a big jump for me. I interviewed and got a job offer from them...and it was within a couple of percent of what I already make. I renegotiated and they said that was the range for the position, and I didn't end up taking it.  I'm so fascinated in this subject because as we know, engineers tend not to be the type to be social butterflies, gossiping at parties about who's dating who. But the second salary and career progression comes up at work, I've seen absolute 180s in personalities and everyone seems to have a buddy who's making 150k-175k here or has salary/bonuses that blow us out of the water, and be unusually confident about how correct their \"map\" of compensation and salaries for engineers are.  I'm wondering where do these people get this information? Even after being an engineer for over a decade, I've never given my opinion on this subject because I don't know any of this stuff for sure. I'd feel embarrassed speaking with such certainty about something that I feel should actually come with many caveats. My personal career is winding and unique. People exaggerate or underrepresent what they make. But in any discussion about engineering salary, there's no shortage of people giving their 2 cents. Where do they get this information? Is there some secret Glassdoor alternative I don't know about? Is it just a natural effect where the people who are most self-confident are the ones who are more likely to speak up? Should a certain percentage of my week be spent networking with the goal of getting salary information and building a \"map\" of what different job functions and industries pay?

My housing cost was about a wash, for you I imagine anywhere you can go it would be much cheaper than the bay area.

The city I lived in is basically always ranked in the top 5 cities for quality of life in the world for any year I have looked and I believe it.

Unless you *really* push the vehicle hard on a hot day, or if you are running aftermarket/performance parts, the impact of this problem is vastly overstated.

{"post_id": "bz0nxk", "domain": "askengineers_test", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "history": "Considering telling my boss that I intend to leave the company in a year. Is this a bad idea? I know what the conventional response is: do not tell your company you intend to quit unless you can afford to be fired that same day. I have seen it on this subreddit, /r/personalfinance, /r/cscareerquestions, etc.   However, I think my situation is unique. I am on a team supporting a project. We previously had 7 people. About 8 months ago, the most senior member on the team, and the only other engineer working with me onsite, retired. We knew this was going to happen, but it was still a huge loss of knowledge. Last week the project manager put in her two weeks' notice for personal reasons. I posted about how I think I am going to have to absorb her responsibility last week. It appears clear now that that is what some of the higher-ups are planning. Previously I was already sort of irreplaceable, but if this happens, I will be the most important member of the project team by far (which is a bad idea in my opinion, beer truck succession planning, etc, in addition to this being well outside of my experience level).   The timing for this expansion is also not great because in two months I start an online master's program in a different field, so I don't really want more responsibility and I definitely don't want more stress. I am a chemical engineer and the master's is in computer science, so not that closely related. To tell my boss that I am starting this program would be tantamount to me telling him I intend to quit at some point in the near future. So there is no telling him one without the other.   Part of me wants to just level with my boss, tell him of my intentions: master's program in August, leave in ~May 2020, support the project until then. There is absolutely 0% chance that I will get fired for telling him this, I can say that for an absolute fact. My company would take at minimum 6 months to get a competent replacement for the previous project manager up to speed, similarly for me. Both the project manager and myself have been working on this project since day one, so we are incredibly familiar with the details of the project. The company literally could not afford to lose both of us. There would be no one left to support the project from an operational and managerial aspect.   What do I have to gain by doing this? Probably not much besides being honest with my boss and allowing them to avert disaster by concentrating all of this responsibility on me and then have me quit in a year (less of a disaster if the project is complete by then, 50/50 shot of that happening). It could help them figure out how we are going to push the project along without putting far too much of the responsibility on me, which would probably result in a better finished product at the end of project.  What do I have to lose by doing this? Nothing really. Or nothing that would matter really. They can't fire me today. If they chose to \"punish\" me in other ways, reduced COL adjustment next year or something, the impact would be insignificant. If they hired a replacement and got them trained up and then fired me in 6 months, that wouldn't be catastrophic either. I have a decent amount saved up already in preparation for quitting. I would find some way to make some income that would allow more time to focus on and accelerate my studies.   What do I have to gain by doing nothing? Nothing. I don't want more responsibility and I'm not looking for more exposure to grow my career within the company.   What do I have to lose by doing nothing?

I think /u/BigBrainMonkey said it best in this thread. I recently attained a job in industry after graduating with a PhD in ME with a focus on mechanics of materials. So, my experience is related to the types of positions for that field.  First of all, let's focus on why you want to get the PhD. You *do not* get a PhD because you think it's going to open up a world of possibilities in that everyone will want to hire you. You get a PhD because you love working on very difficult specific problems which have very likely not even been attempted before. You also like to get to a fundamental understanding behind these problems. You can see how this description aligns perfectly with research. It also opens up a world outside of research pertaining to the most difficult technical challenges an industry or company might encounter.  So, where you work after finishing the PhD? There are 3 primary areas as I see it: (1) academia, (2) national labs, and (3) industry.  * Academia - teaching and research. Currently, it is very difficult to get a tenure-track academic position. The upside of academia is you define your own work and collaborate with some of the best minds in a subject area. The downside is become a glorified program manager immediately - you don't do most of the work, your students do. You are also constantly fighting for funding. Also, normally before you can get a tenure track position you need to complete a 2-3 year stint as a post-doc. * National Lab - research and project work. The work at national labs is fairly varied but you still get to do research-type work. Most national labs require you to enter as a post-doc and then offer you a full-time position as a staff scientist after 1-2 years depending on appointment and the specific lab. The downside is many of these jobs require a security clearance so it's limited to US citizens. The culture at different labs varies greatly and no one is the same as another, e.g., LLNL is very different from ORNL. * Industry - almost all project work. One professor I know has said the age of true industrial research is gone, which in reality is not a bad thing. There are many good and bad things that people have hinted at in this thread. To be honest, this is the area I am least familiar with at this point, but I'll go through some points that I have been brought up by others and what I can say from my experience and the experience of the many PhDs I know who went to work in industry. It's important to note when looking at positions in industry you should take not of some advice I was given by an acquaintance at the NRC. In more or less words: \"I don't hire PhDs for what they currently know and what their academic research topic was. I hire them because the PhD is effectively a license to solve very difficult, ill-defined problems which have no prior answer and push the bounds of current engineering knowledge.\"   I'll try and go through some things about industry:  * \"You are too qualified for most positions and your opportunities are limited\" - This is absolutely 100% true. You are too qualified for most positions and because of that you have limited your opportunities. But, let's assume you got your PhD for the right reasons - research/advanced development oriented work. So, do you really want those jobs? Do you really want to do the normal BS qualified test engineer position? It's not a knock on those positions at all, you just have to make sure you get the PhD knowing full well that you want to do \"research-type\" work. So, even if you were able to get those jobs on an equal playing field, you wouldn't want to do them anyways. * \"In my experience, mostly heavy industries, outside of advanced development and research there very few PhDs around\" - This is again absolutely true. Why would a company want to pay the premium that a PhD demands when they can have someone with a BS or MS do the same work just as effectively. The PhD holds its weight in positions which are normally highly analytical or computational heavy. Projects or areas that would require more specific training and in-depth knowledge. This is what your PhD gives you, the knowledge to solve these very difficult problems. The PhD also says that you can effectively self-teach yourself very difficult new topics. This is what you did during your dissertation research, is it not? You taught yourself to the edge of knowledge of a very specific topic. This has shown you can do this and could do it again. * \"Be commissioned and trusted to develop entirely new methods, or technologies\" - Again, this absolutely true. As I just said above, you know how to push the edge of the unknown. * \"Many employers will be afraid to hire you for fear of you leaving when you realize you are making the same as your BS/MS counterparts\" - If you encounter this, then you're looking in the wrong places. The places that know they need PhDs will know what they're looking for and won't be afraid to hire a PhD. You'll also be paid appropriate for the PhD. There are websites which list the starting salaries of PhDs in different fields, etc. I know the average starting salary of an ME PhD is right around $90k, with that going up or down based on industry and location. The average starting post-doc at a national lab is around $72k, I believe. Is it going to be harder to find a job? Significantly harder but that's because there's significantly less of them available which are appropriate for you. * \"NASA and JPL have position that require at least a masters. Some even require a phd.\" - These are effectively the positions you're looking at when you're looking for jobs. Look around at the jobs postings at most large companies including JPL, SpaceX, Boeing, Lockheed, GM, GE, etc. You'll see a decent number of positions that are MS required, PhD preferred (note, they even have a decent number of 0 year experience entry level positions with these requirements). A majority of these positions will be computationally focused - think FEA and CFD. Look around at these to get a sense of the jobs that are available to PhDs. * \"You go for industries which look for a specific qualification and there are some of them in which is easier to go up in the 'ranking' thanks to a Ph.D.\" - This is the last point I wanted to make. By having a PhD, you no longer have a ceiling on the technical track at most companies. You'll notice the more senior technical positions will start requiring MS and PhD. Also, these positions are significantly more saturated with PhDs than at the less senior levels.  I hope this helps some. I know it's a wall of text, but I just wanted to give some context from the PhD side of things since we are likely going to underrepresented in a sub like this. If there's any PhDs with more experience in industry, feel free to come by and kick the shit out of my answers. This is just my opinion from my own experience and experience of others I know.  As a note, from personal experience, the job I recently attained is not in a company's research lab. I accepted a position doing high strain rate computational mechanics focusing on fracture phenomena for a large company. The position is in the advanced development arm of the company. FWIW, during the hiring process, the manager told me that they are now hiring a minimum MS with a strong preference for PhDs. Apparently, BS level hires, even with some experience, were not working out doing this work for one reason or another. That's just my experience and I'm entirely sure if it's typical or atypical.", "human_ref_B": "Get called \"Doc\" or \"The Doctor\" by all your coworkers.", "labels": 1, "seconds_difference": 15400.0, "score_ratio": 1.0714285714}

Another is the balance of various chemicals in the plant vs the soil.  This creates osmotic pressure that forces water into the roots, where it is actually under some pressure, which amplifies the two effects above.

Why couldn't it be a sole ground support/attack aircraft?", "c_root_id_A": "cit6aq9", "c_root_id_B": "cit5fnk", "created_at_utc_A": 1404961261, "created_at_utc_B": 1404959343, "score_A": 103, "score_B": 7, "human_ref_A": "Multi-role is proven to work, the F-16 and F-18 programs are proof enough of that.   One problem is that the F-35 is actually three aircraft pretending to be one. I haven't actually looked at the numbers, but if you divide the cost of the program by three, I doubt it's still the most expensive weapons program in history. So, I bet the cost problems are exaggerated to some extent because journalists never actually know what they're talking about.  Multi-role doesn't really overload a modern fighter with too many requirements, but trying to be three different jets at once clearly does. There are just too many compromises that have to be made in order to keep some semblance of part interchangeability between the different versions.  As far as performance, I think the main problem is that the \"all-stealth air force\" idea is a stupid one. Stealth is great, but it's more of a niche technology. For instance, a stealth air superiority fighter is a great idea. A stealth deep strike or SEAD aircraft is also a great idea. However, stealth makes a lot less sense for a lot of ground-attack missions, and pretty much no sense for CAS.   The design constraints placed on the F-35 by the stealth design prevent it from being as good at these roles as people expected it to be. It simply can't carry enough stuff internally to be able to do missions the same way the F-16 or F-18 can. Those are more successful as multi-role aircraft because you can load them very heavily for a strike mission, or load them more lightly for an air superiority mission. The F-35 had to be designed lightly for the air superiority mission, but then fattened so it had a prayer of doing ground-attack. But because of the stealth restrictions, it can't do a very good job of that mission. So it ends up being an all-round turd.  The other problem is the classic American acquisitions problem of asking for the moon. They decide to include all these nonexistent technologies as key features of the new aircraft. You end up with a hybrid production-design/research project. Research projects always take longer than you expect, which means going over-budget. But now you're doing your research on a full production scale, which means instead of spending $4 million when you thought it would be $2 million, those numbers start with a 'b'. The fact that you're doing this with not just one technology, but 20, and trying to make all these brand-new things work together at the same time, means you're fucked for sure. There's just no way to do that without it turning into a disaster. We really need to do more small-scale research at high TRL before we decide to include this stuff in front-line hardware.", "human_ref_B": "I don't think the problem was the design. Most of the technology for the 3 variants makes sense to interchange between each other and still be under the same F-35 name (minus the lift system of course). We know the harrier is extremely obsolete and in need of a successor, and the F-35B is a great replacement.  The problem came with the production choices. First off, the budget cuts caused one of the two engines being developed to be, quite literally, scraped. In addition to being manufactured separately than the current engine, the design differences would provide much more stability in fleet, eliminating the 'ground the fleet because of one engine fire' situation. Plus congressional pandering split up the production making it highly inefficient and costly; production is spread out over 45 states.  Making it multi-role, in theory, should have lowered long term costs. Theoretically more nations would be interested in buying in because the chance of it meeting their needs is higher, and the service on them would be more accessible do to the larger quantity. But I don't know much about this stuff, so I'm just speculating.   Also the not actually being stealth is very disappointing, but from what I've heard there was really no way to predict that.  All in all, I think we need the F-35. Our current technology is extremely old, and is essentially being dissected and upgraded in pieces when it is better to just start fresh. However, I also believe the F-22 should remain in production, as that is a great aircraft and can do things the F-35 just isn't designed for.", "labels": 1, "seconds_difference": 1918.0, "score_ratio": 14.7142857143}

The Merlin is used on the ground for the lower stage; the Kestrel is used in space.  Liquid fueled rocket engines like the Merlin are actually similar to jet engines in certain ways; they both use a turbine powered pump (called a turbopump) which is not unlike the turbine/compressor in a jet engine.  With the Kestrel, though, which only operates in a vacuum, the turbopump isn't really required; rocket engine efficiency is related to the expansion ratio, so really high pressures are only required when the thing has to operate in an atmosphere.  The possible expansion ratio in outer space is not so limited and thus the \"jet engine-like\" parts of the rocket engine -- which are also the expensive and tricky parts -- aren't required for the Kestrel.  RP1 (\"jetfuel\") is less efficient on an energy-per-mass basis than liquid hydrogen.  However it is also more dense, which is nice, and much easier to handle.

The exaust velocity of a turbofan is around 300 m/s and that of a good rocket is around 3,000 m/s.  In space the mass efficiency, how much propellant you have to expel to change your spaceship's velocity by a given amount, is entirely a factor of the exhaust velocity.  The reason that a jet engine is so efficient on the ground is that very little of the propellant that comes out of the engine is fuel that has to be carried by the airplane.  Mostly it's atmospheric nitrogen with the water and CO2 combustion products of the fuel combustion mixed in.  Since the fuel that has to be carried is such a small fraction of the exhaust stream a jet operating in the atmosphere is as efficient as if it was expelling the fuel at 30,000 m/s.  Having an unlimited amount of gas you can stuff into your engine is useful!  There are engines called turborockets that use the energy from the rocket to drive a turbofan that adds atmospheric gases to the exhaust to increase the rocket efficiency.  Not as much as with a jet engine since the rocket brings its own oxidizer but quite a bit.  And you still get most of the great thrust to weight ratio a rocket gives you.

I worked for 2 years at a small engineering company before being laid off about 4 months ago. I think it was a mix of things that lead to me being laid off. I have not been able to really find any jobs in my field in Houston since that time.  There don't seem to be any job postings for positions relevant to my experience and I am afraid I will be running out of money in the next 6 months.    As far as my experience with my previous job, I felt fairly anxious from the beginning.  From the interview, the company said they were fairly intense and had high expectations and that I would be working mainly in the marine department, but also picking up slack in the structural department.  For the first 9 months things went fairly well, but then it started falling apart.  They ran out of work in the marine department from that point on and I never really did anymore meaningful work like that again which was what I went to school for and was  a major disappointment for me.  They transitioned me to the structural department and I started getting up to speed there on a few small projects.  I enjoyed the freedom to create solutions myself, but I struggled with several aspects of the job, mainly that I was slow to produce results (mainly fab and test drawings, and load reports).  Then, I got some very tedious, time consuming, and low low low priority jobs.  I honestly think they were just biding time hoping more work would come, but it never did. I tried in earnest at first to complete them, but then they just gave me more of the same.   From here, I got very depressed/frustrated with my work.  It felt meaningless, I could never get priority on drafting rescources, and my managers would check in on me about twice a week for a few minutes top because these jobs were so low priority. I tried to bring up my concerns, but it was a fight to get anyones attention for more than 5 minutes, and I was afraid to say I was wasting my time and being unproductive.  I would get stuck often but no one would take me seriously if I asked for help, the projects were conceptually simple but logistical nightmares, so their answers were dismissive in my opinion, they would just spitball some ideas that fix one problem but created 3 more and just seemed annoyed that I was wasting more of their time.  I won't lie, it got to me and I started dreading working on these projects. I started wasting time.  I was on my phone, or browsing the web a bit, but mostly it felt like I was just staring into space hoping that something would come along and help me get through these projects. I fell behind on deadlines, made a lot of mistakes on the work that was being completed that had to be reworked or fixed later, and it all culminated in a colossal mistake that embarrassed the company although it didn't cause damage or cost too much relatively.    If i'm honest, I feel like they massively mismanaged my hiring and training process, and also that I didn't put in 100%.  All of my coworkers had masters in structural and more experience.  I would never have been hired into the role without the managers tossing me around.  There was one coworker who was exactly the same qualifications as me but a few years older, he got all of whatever work went into the marine department, and I ran support on the very limited occasions he needed it.  I could never convince anyone to make this split more fair on continue my training in that discipline to get me to the level where I could take any more of it on, I just got stuck with more structural work.  I did like many parts of my job, and I did not feel any of it was beneath me, I just felt that I wasn't suited for the structural work and that I wasn't particularly good with it.  I am at a loss as for what to do next.  I can't find a job, or even get interviews and I feel like its because my experience is this awkward hodgepodge of random things.  The oil and gas industry has been in a slump, so there arent many jobs out there anyway.  I feel like I have been working too long and that I am being passed over for entry level positions when I would be more than happy and willing to try a soft reset on my career.  I have a lot of doubt about whether my company was just a bad experience for me, because I had 1 coworker in particular who seemed to flourish in that environment and got all the marine work for himself, while I floundered.  Is it me? Was it legitimately a lack of work and just poor timing like they said in my exit interview? Am I cut out for this career, or should I try and find something else before I run out of money/time?  Is this experience normal? My biggest fear is that I get another job and that this is just standard practice, and I am not cut out for all of this.    I guess I am just looking for reassurance, advice, other perspectives. Anything really.  I learned a lot from all this and I have been forced to really look inwards and evaluate what I need to fix, and I am willing to do it.  My family and friends have been a huge support, but getting fired really has brought up a lot of self-doubt about whether I can be a successful engineer.

However, we've also removed a number of comments that reflect common misunderstandings around the genocide(s) of American Indians.   This message is not intended to provide all the answers, but simply to address some of the basic facts, as well as genocide denialism in this regard, and provide a short list of introductory reading. Because this topic covers a large area of study, the actions of the United States will be highlighted. There is always more that can be said, but we hope this is a good starting point.   ##What is Genocide?  Since the conceptualization of the act of genocide, scholars have developed a variety of frameworks to evaluate instances that may be considered genocide. One of the more common frameworks is the definition and criteria implemented by the United Nations. The term \"genocide,\" as coined by Raphael Lemkin in 1943, was defined by the U.N. in 1948. The use of this term was further elaborated by the genocide convention.  Article II describes two elements of the crime of genocide:  1. The mental element, meaning the \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such\", and 2. The physical element which includes five acts described in sections a, b, c, d and e. A crime must include both elements to be called \"genocide.\"  Article II: In the present convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such:  * (a) Killing members of the group; * (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; * (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; * (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; * (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.  ##American Indian Genocides \u2013 Did they happen?  Since the arrival of Europeans to the Americas, typically signaled with the appearance of Columbus in 1492, Indigenous Peoples have experienced systematic oppression and extermination at the hands of colonial powers. These colonizing governments either organized or sponsored acts of genocide perpetrated by settlers, targeting Indigenous settlements for complete destruction; eliminating sources of food and access to life-sustaining resources; instituting child separation policies; and forcefully relocating Indigenous populations to often times inhospitable tracts of land, now known as \u201creservations.\u201d All of these acts constitute what scholars now recognize as genocide. The horrendous acts that occurred in the Americas were even an example proposed by Lemkin himself, where it is noted from his writings:  >Lemkin applied the term to a wide range of cases including many involving European colonial projects in Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and the Americas. A recent investigation of an unfinished manuscript for a global history of genocide Lemkin was writing in the late 1940s and early 1950s reveals an expansive view of what Lemkin termed a \u201cSpanish colonial genocide.\u201d He never began work on a projected chapter on \u201cThe Indians of North America,\u201d though his notes indicate that he was researching Indian removal, treaties, the California gold rush, and the Plains wars.  These actions took place over the entirety of the Americas, exacerbating the rapid depopulation of Indigenous Nations and communities. Exact figures of the population decline are inconclusive, giving us only estimates at best, with Pre-Columbian population numbers ranging anywhere from as low as 8 million to as high as ~100 million inhabitants across North, Central, and South America. What we do know is that in the United States, records indicate the American Indian population had dropped to approximately 250,000 by 1900. Despite any debate about population statistics, the historical records and narratives conclude that, at least according to the U.N. definition, genocide was committed.  ##Mental Element: Establishing Intent  In order for genocide to be committed, there must be reasonable evidence to establish an intent to commit what constitutes genocide. Through both word and action, we can see that colonial powers, such as the United States, did intend at times to exterminate American Indian populations, often with public support. Government officials, journalists, scholars, and public figures echoed societal sentiments regarding their desire to destroy Indians, either in reference to specific groups or the whole race.  >\u201dThis unfortunate race, whom we had been taking so much pains to save and to civilize, have by their unexpected desertion and ferocious barbarities justified extermination and now await our decision on their fate.\u201d  --Thomas Jefferson, 1813]( https://www.loc.gov/resource/mtj1.047_0147_0150/?sp=3)  >\"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected.\"  [--California Governor Peter Burnett, 1851  >\". . .these Indians will in the end be exterminated. They must soon be crushed - they will be exterminated before the onward march of the white man.\"  --U.S. Senator John Weller, 1852, page 17, citation 92  ##Physical Element: Acting with Purpose  **U.S. Army Policy of Killing Buffalo (Criterion C)**  In this post, it is explained how it was the intention and policy of the U.S. Army to kill the buffalo of America off in an attempt to subdue, and even exterminate, the Plains Indians.  **Sterilization (Criterion D)**  The Indian Health Service (IHS) is a federally run service for American Indians and Alaska Natives. It is responsible for providing proper health care for American Indians as established via the treaties and trust relationship between tribes and the U.S. Government. However, on November 6, 1976, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released the results of an investigation that concluded that between 1973 and 1976, IHS performed 3,406 sterilizations on Native American women. Per capita, this figure would be equivalent to sterilizing 452,000 non-Native American women. Many of these sterilizations were conducted without the consent of the women being sterilized or under coercion.  **Boarding Schools (Criterion E)**  The systematic removal of Indian children from their parents and placement into boarding schools was a policy implemented by the United States meant to force American Indian children to assimilate into American culture,]( https://redd.it/8zgozt) thus \u201c[killing] the Indian, [and saving] the man.\u201d These schools were operated by various entities, including the federal government and church/missionary organizations. While constituting cultural genocide as well, American Indian children were beaten, neglected, and barred from practicing their cultures. Some children even died at these schools.  ##But What About the Diseases?  In the United States, a subtle state of denial exists regarding portions of this country's history. One of the biggest issues concerning the colonization of the Americas is whether or not this genocide was committed by the incoming colonists. And while the finer points of this subject are still being discussed, few academics would deny that acts of genocide were committed. However, there are those who vehemently attempt to refute conclusions made by experts and assert that no genocide occurred. These [\u201cmethods of denialism\u201d are important to recognize to avoid being manipulated by those who would see the historical narratives change for the worse.  One of the primary methods of denial is the over severity of diseases introduced into the Americas after the arrival of the colonizers, effectively turning these diseases into ethopoeic scapegoats responsible for the deaths of Indigenous Peoples. While it is true that disease was a huge component of the depopulation of the Americas, often resulting in up to a 95% mortality rate for many communities and meaning *some* communities endured more deaths from disease, these effects were greatly exacerbated by actions of colonization.  ##Further Reading  Though there is much information about this topic, this introductory list of books and resources provide ample evidence to attest the information presented here:  * *Beyond Germs: Native Depopulation in North America* edited by Catherine Cameron, Paul Kelton, and Alan Swedlund * *American Indian Holocaust and Survival: A Population History Since 1492* by Russell Thornton * *Murder State: California's Native American Genocide, 1846-1873* by Brendan Lindsay * *Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur* by Ben Kiernan * *American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World* by David Stannard * *Myths of Conquest* by /u/anthropology_nerd * AskHistorians FAQ", "human_ref_B": "Just to address this from a different perspective, ie why is the Holocaust considered unique, I will link to an answer by  u/commiespaceinvader to the question \"When people discuss the Holocaust, why do they focus mainly on the killing of the 6 million Jews?\"]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/564gvm/comment/d8g92dz/).  Specifically:  >\"In short the Western imagination of itself had experienced atrocities and horrors inflicted against political opponents, \"deviants\", and colonial subjects but it had never experienced that all it used to define itself as good and progressive \u2013 the modern state and its bureaucracy, industry, science, the police \u2013 was used to murder an entire group of European peoples.\"  It's old but I will also link to a [comment by u/400-rabbits on Stannard, which adds a bit of complexity - there are multiple historic Holocausts and they are all unique, if interrelated.  One thing I will add in addition to those answers is that when one is comparing the Holocaust to Indigenous peoples of the Americas, you're dealing with vastly different things in terms of time and scale - it's not just a numbers game. When we are talking about indigenous peoples of the Americas, we are discussing hundreds of different groups, who had very different experiences at the hands of different actors. Which is to say it makes it hard to talk about a singular \"genocide\" - the answer from u/EdHistory101 specifically focuses on the United States government in the 19th and 20th centuries, but that is part of a much larger history of conflict and dispossession of indigenous peoples lasting from the 1490s to literally this very moment, involving a vast array of actors. To be more comparable you'd probably need to compare the entire history of European anti-semitism from 1492 to the present.   The Holocaust itself is historically a much more concentrated event, involving one government as a prime mover (the NSDAP regime in Germany), which intentionally targeted Jews in Europe for industrialized mass killing, most of which took place over a three year period during the war (ETA a 2019 study found 25% of Holocaust victims were actually murdered in a three month period). Not only was this genocide extremely intentional and organized and planned to an exceptional level of detail, but Germany made it an overriding policy objective, even in its relations with friendly/allied countries - there were even low-level discussions between German and Japanese officials about the possibility of murdering the 20,000 Jewish refugees in Shanghai (the Japanese refused).   However, even with that said I should point out via this thread that there is an ongoing historic debate at the moment as to how much white settlement of the Americas directly inspired Nazi policies and goals in Eastern Europe.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 11868.0, "score_ratio": 1.5743440233}

Looking back at Hoyland it seems these thing are weren't as ubiquitous as you make it seem. He mostly cites only one or two sources for each claim. How common or prevalent these things were remains unseen. The time period was long enough and pre-Islamic society diverse enough where we cannot take these things as representative.   > women could marry multiple men  Hoyland says;   > Diversity in marriage customs is also evident in the degree to which monogamy, polygyny (one man many wives) and polyandry (one woman many husbands) all crop up in our sources.   Hoyland then goes on to quote a source saying polyandry was practiced as fraternal polyandry and brothers would share a wife.   > Arab tribes sometimes having matrilinear lineages  Hoyland says;  > While  descent  through  the  male  line  would  seem  to  have  been the norm in pre-Islamic Arabia, we are occasionally given hints of matrilineal arrangements.  The problem with discussing pre-Islamic Arabia is that there just aren't that many sources let alone sources about women, to give insight on how most women lived. So it becomes difficult to make any kind of judgment about how \"liberal\" pre-Islamic society was. Even Hoyland's book only discusses women in society for six pages and mostly only discusses the things you mentioned here. Hoyland's book does not give a rigorous enough discussion to make any kind of judgement on the \"liberalness\" of pre-Islamic Arabia. The things discussed do not in and of themselves indicate a women-friendly or sexually liberal society. These things can still exist in a patriarchal and misogynist society. Hoyland also mentions that women were encountered \"first and foremost as wives and mothers.\" Not to mention they may not have been as ubiquitous as the book suggests.   One of the largest sources for information on pre-Islamic Arabia come from Islamic sources themselves. However Islamic sources are not charitable to the position of women in pre-Islamic Arabia and characterized the time as a time of ignorance and barbarism. For example sources mention things like bride kidnapping, forced marriage, marriage by inheritance, female infanticide, forced prostitution etc. Islamic sources saw Islam as elevating the position of position of women in Arabia and giving them rights like the right to divorce, the right to consent to marriage, right to a bride-price, etc. Early Muslims who had known both pre-Islamic and post-Islamic Arabia commented on the positive turn Islam had given women in terms of women's status in society.   So we actually don't know very much what it was actually like for women in pre-Islamic Arabia and cannot make judgements about how \"liberal\" or \"women-friendly\" it actually was. There simply isn't enough historical information to make this kind of judgment.", "human_ref_B": "Hey!  So this has a couple of different parts that I hope to address.  I can't give a super specific answer, but will try to touch on a number of facets you could ask follow-up questions about.  I'm pulling some from previous answers that I have written, but much of this is also new.  A great book on this topic is Leila Ahmed's book *Women and Gender in Islam*, which I will heavily use below.  # Part 1 \u2013 Quick Note on Veiling Itself  Because you specifically mentioned it, I wanted to start with a small section on veiling itself.  Veiling was common practice in multiple pre-Islamic societies across the Middle East.  In Assyrian culture wearing a veil separated between a 'respectable' woman and those who were 'up for grabs', so to say.  Upper class women, concubines accompanying those women, and former \"sacred prostitutes\" all had to wear it whereas normal prostitutes and slaves were forbidden from veiling themselves, even so far as being under threat of flogging or having their ears cut off.  Ahmed then writes that this practice spread throughout the upper-class Mediterranean world - from the Levant through to Persia - and also crossed religious lines appearing in Byzantine Christian societies.  Here, Ahmed gives the example of a 10th century Byzantine patriarch who wrote that he only allowed his daughter to go out \"veiled and suitable chaperoned\".  She also notes the reasoning, separating the respectable from the rabble, remains constant even in these other societies.    However, that is not to say that veiling was necessarily widespread in Arabia itself.  Women of the *jahilyya* pre-Islamic period did not normally don a veil. This of course varied from city to countryside, with cities being more likely to veil.  Overall, nowhere was the veil common to the extent of places like neighboring Syria and Palestine.  As you noted in your question, sexual relations in Arabia were more open than in those other societies, with both polygamy and polyandry being present.   Through Muhammad's entire life, the only women who were regularly veiled or secluded were his wives. Through successful revelations received by Muhammad, the practice of veiling and seclusion took hold among them, getting to the point where the phrasing \"she took the veil\" became synonymous to \"she became a wife of Muhammad\".  Various impetuses pushed Muhammad towards these rulings.  For example, it was after he became annoyed with guests staying too long chatting with his wives after dinner that the Sura 33 was revealed, within which verse 54 details that one should only speak to Muhammad's wives from behind a curtain. The word he uses for curtain is *\u1e25ij\u0101b*.  Most westerners associate the word *hijab* with some sort of head-wrap of veil, but it also literally can mean 'veil' in the sense of a curtain.  Verse 59 then gives the commandment to women to \"bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused.\"  This is allegedly in response to the \"hypocrites\", mere nominal converts to Islam, harassing Muslim women and claiming to have thought they were slaves.  Finally, I should note that the later second Caliph, Omar, was a proponent of seclusion of women and veiling and actively pushed Muhammad towards this position.  # Part 2 \u2013 The evolution of the Woman\u2019s place  This is what I suspect to be the more interesting section \u2013 why did Islam develop the way it did, when women played such major roles in pre-Islamic and early Islamic times?  In the *jahilyya*, and within early Islam, women contributed in a number of facets of life.  Women were soothsayers and prophetesses such as Sajah, a Christian woman of the Ban\u016b Tam\u012bm who led a force of over 4,000 along with Musaylimah, \u201cThe Liar\u201d, in rebellion against the nascent Muslim state.  Like the previous sentence indicates, they were also involved in warfare. They were not only poets, telling stories of the battles and engaging in ritualistic pre-battle exchanges of insults, but also warriors themselves. Umm \u2018Umara fought at a number of battles alongside men, eventually losing her hand at the Battle of \u2018Uqraba in 634.  Women were heavily involved in early Islamic religious life, providing the many of the *hadith* that came to guide religious life.  It was common for them to remarry, showing there to be a lack of stigma against non-virgins, and often they brought significant wealth to these relationships (Muhammad\u2019s first wife, Khadija, was one such widow.  15 years his senior, she was rich enough to allow Muhammad to not have to work, allowing him to instead focus on his spiritual teachings).   #**So why did this begin to change?**  The changes actually started before the spread of Islam, as merchants in urban Arabian cities were increasingly exposed to the norms and cultures of lands with much more rigid gender roles.  This can be seen as an explanation as to why it was the cities, not the countryside, that first adopted veiling.  However, what brought the changes into hyperdrive was the rapid expansion of the early Islamic Empire.  Not only did this bring increased contact with these foreign cultures, but it also brought an influx of slaves, diminishing the bargaining power of even Arab-born women.   The conquests brought untold wealth to the Arabs.  Even regular soldiers were able to afford slaves, houses, and concubines.  Accordingly, women lost one of their original bargaining chips \u2013 the wealth they brought to marriages.  Further, as a condition for surrendering and keeping their place, many Persian and Sassanian nobles converted to Islam. They kept, however, their original cultures.  One of the features that developed around this time was the harem, with a multitude of women being walled off for rich and powerful men, guarded only by Eunuchs.  With easy access to sex slaves, Ahmed argues that the line between \u201cwoman\u201d and \u201cobject\u201d started to blur.  Men did not need to put up with the demands stipulated by Arab women\u2019s wedding contracts when they had access to sex elsewhere.  Women faced increasingly strict restrictions and were treated increasingly poorly.  Some elite men even went so far as to lament the fact that they had to marry their daughters, as their standards of living would so dramatically fall.  Ahmed included the following poem in her book, written from one noble man to another on the occasion of his daughter\u2019s death.  This did not come from a sense of general misogyny, that daughters were worthless, but rather from the degradations and humiliations their daughters were liable to face.   > To Abu Hasan I offer condolences.   > At times of disaster and catastrophe   > God multiplies rewards for the patient.   > To be patient in misery   > Is equivalent to giving thanks for a gift.   > Among the blessings of God undoubtedly   > Is the preservation of sons   > And the death of daughters.  But cultural and economic changes are only a portion of the story.  Also in play was the religious framework that marriage operated within. Islamic law works through a local judge, a *Qadi*, issuing a ruling on a specific case so that it is in line with religious teachings (we have to note that there was no separation between the illegal and the immoral, but rather they were the one and the same).  However, while the Qur\u2019an protected women\u2019s rights in a number of areas, judges often interpreted these not as legally binding rules, but rather as binding only upon the individual\u2019s conscience.  So, a man would not be legally bound to treat his 4 wives fairly, even if that is a stipulation within the Qur\u2019an itself. There was, in essence, the loss of many Qur\u2019anic provisions that could protect women.  The 11th century also brought the *Closing of the Gates of Ijtihad*.  That is, Islamic jurisprudence reached a point where they (allegedly) decided that there had been sufficient rulings in the past that any questions which need an answer were answerable, and it is was longer necessary to use independent reasoning to come to new solutions (for more on this, see my answere [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7vynzv/when_and_why_did_muslim_countries_stop_using_the/dtwak37/))  This in essence froze many Islamic teachings. There are 4 main schools of Sunni Islamic thought, and at the point of the closing of the gates of Ijtihad, only the Maliki school allowed for women to obtain a divorce on the grounds of desertion or cruelty. Meanwhile, only the Hanafi school fully enforced marriage contracts that would bind a man to monogamy.  While before the closing of these gates a judge could, theoretically, use his own reasoning to analogize and come to a new ruling, they were now largely bound to *taqlid*, imitation of the past. So, these doctrines, along with countless others controlling women\u2019s lives, ceased to develop at the same speed as before.  That is not to say that women were completely locked out, as one could effectively \u201cshop\u201d between the different schools of thought for the most favorable ruling.  There is much, much more one could write on this topic, but I unfortunately have work that I have to do.  I hope this can help begin to answer your question, and if you have follow-ups I\u2019ll try to respond if possible.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 1872.0, "score_ratio": 2.7487684729}

And then we try to shore the literary fragments against the ruins, and extrapolate a world. Can we know what individuals thought? Unless they were kind enough to write it down for us (and their jottings survived), no. But to the extent that the literature and the archaeological remains seem to agree, and to the extent that our cross-cultural models allow us to understand them, we can usually form a picture, however hazy, of practice and belief in an ancient society.   As devoted readers of this sub, you know all this already. I just felt like pontificating. For a little more substance, let's turn, all too briefly, to the Greeks and Romans.   Two blanket statements. First, virtually all Greeks and Romans believed in their gods. Second, belief in the gods did not necessarily translate to a literal understanding of the traditional myths about those gods.   Greek religion and Roman religion - to use conventional shorthands for what were actually loose families of affiliated but distinctive local practices - were focused on practice, rather than belief. The gods, in other words, were assumed to be much more interested in what their worshipers did for them than in what their worshipers thought them. This meant, in effect, that the act of sacrifice was the ultimate statement of belief: gratifying the gods with burnt offerings (or libations, etc.) was at once a prudent insurance policy and an effective profession of faith. It might be tempting to imagine (by analogy with modern religious holidays) that traditional religious festivals in the classical world eventually became more or less formalities - a chance for everybody to kick back, watch a little drama, and enjoy a bit of barbecued ox. For some Greeks and Romans, they may well have become so. But the mere fact that sacrifices continued regularly, century after century, in so many ancient cities suggests that the great majority took them quite seriously: the gods were real, and had to be placated. To this can be added the vast body of evidence for personal devotion to the gods - family altars, ex voto offerings, dedications at shrines, etc., etc. And to that we may add the testimonials provided by our  literary sources, which establish beyond a shadow of a doubt that the great majority of Greeks and Romans assumed that the gods were very real.   None of this means, of course, that they took the myths seriously. As early as the sixth century BC, Greek philosophers and public intellectuals began to criticize the myths. Some of the more radical thinkers of the Classical period theorized that the myths were actually dimly-remembered episodes from ancient history, and that the gods had originally been human kings and inventors. Others speculated that the gods and the myths had been deliberately invented in the distant past as a means of political control. Similar strands of criticism are visible in Stoic philosophy (which treated the myths as allegories), in Epicurean philosophy (which treated the myths as dangerous fables), and in the general intellectual milieu of the Roman imperial era (see, for example, the splendid satires of Lucian). It seems clear that most educated Greeks and Romans really did regard the myths as a matter of cultural literacy, not literal truth. But their disdain for the myths was motivated largely by a desire to disassociate them from the gods, in whom most of them still believed. The myths, it was thought, were unworthy of the gods, and the gods undeserving of the myths foisted upon them by tradition.   I could cite various passages from ancient authors in support of all this; but frankly, I'm tired. The point, in any case, needs no belaboring. In certain contexts, many Greeks and Romans were perfectly comfortable mocking the gods of myth - take Dionysus in Aristophanes' Frogs, or Zeus in any of Lucian's dialogues. There were even \"theme parks\" of a sort, in the case of Ilium, a major tourist destination on what was thought to be the site of Homer's Troy (more on such tourism here). But for most Greeks and Romans (with the exception of those wretched atheistic Epicureans), the gods were real. Take the emperor Julian's heartfelt (if tedious) hymn to Cybele, or Apuleius' paean to Isis, or Aelius Aristides' praises of Ascelpius, or even - at the beginning of classical literature - Odysseus' relationship with Athena. The Greeks and Romans didn't always take their gods seriously.

If I had to sum things up, I would say \"religion and prophecy,\" but that also is not very interesting in and of itself.  **Joan as Holy Woman**  From Joan's own testimony at her trial, it is easily apparent that she was deeply immersed in the religious culture of her time. The saints most important to her are the most popular ones, she's right with the new trend in angels, she's sold on the rising importance of devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus.  This is important because Joan fits firmly in the context of the early 15th century as a holy woman and prophet. Her visions and auditions anchor her in a tradition going back to the mid-12th century of women who used the message that they spoke and acted based on direct revelation from God.   In Joan's time, *some* people are starting to question the validity of holy women's claims. The initial questions themselves, though in some ways the culmination of a longer trend, are highly political as a result of the Avignon papacy and (especially) the Great Schism (ca1378-1415). In other words, they are very much tied to ecclesiastical politics.  On the ground level, what we find is much more ongoing confidence in women's revelations. 14th century saints and visionaries Catherine of Siena and especially Birgitta of Sweden are *all the rage*. People even start attributing to Birgitta texts that she didn't write; she's that famous and popular even among the literate classes. Birgitta (and Pseudo-Birgitta) becomes especially well-known for two things that transcend the literacy barrier: prophecy and a set of prayers.  Not everyone, but a whole lot of people, took Joan absolutely seriously as conveying divine messages directly. In very particular, Charles VII was raised in an environment where his parents firmly believed in the prophetic powers of holy women. Charles VI had given audience to Jeanne-Marie de Maill\u00e9; and Isabeau, to Marie Robine (a peasant, by the way).   And this was, of course, the key issue at her initial and nullification (rehabilitation) trials: were Joan's fake or real; demonic or divine...according to the political beliefs of the judge or witness. For a demonstration, turn to no less a contemporary authority than French \"theologian &c\" Jean Gerson (uh...he was Really Important; roll with it), who is infamously on the record as opposing the legitimacy of holy women...but wrote dramatically in support of Joan.  **Joan and Wonders**  Kelly DeVries, who is basically *the* authority on Joan as a soldier and commander, stresses the importance of religion in the accounts of Joan's contemporary supporters as well as her own (*Joan of Arc: A Military Leader*, but especially \"A Woman as a Leader of Men\" in *Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc*, which is, well, about this question's precise topic). He's right, although his account is based on Joan's full career, including her victories. Which, again, is a liiiittle bit of a cop-out.  I want to go back to the 15th century mindset again, to look at the overall supernatural cosmology of the era. Well into the early modern era, there's no real divide between what we would call \"religion\" and \"magic.\" (Indeed, \"religion\" doesn't even have our meaning until the 15th century.) As with belief in revelations from God, people live in a world of wonders and miracles and saints and supernatural creatures. But as seen with growing concern with witchcraft and questions about holy women's sincerity, the boundaries are just starting to be sketched out by some people.  This is especially apparent in Joan's case. The wonders associated with her don't really have a division in what she relates about other people's support of her. They *do* have a divide in the mindset of her interrogators--and, because Joan is frakking *awesome*, she knows exactly what they're doing and keeps pace. (Seriously, read Dan Hobbins' translation *The Trial of Joan of Arc*. She's great.)  A big one is Joan's knowledge of and then the discovery of \"her sword\" in a church dedicated to one of France's most important saints. The finding of a blessed object has major precursors in the Middle Ages, especially associated with the Crusades. In the 15th century, that was more important than ever. The *physical reality* of objects was critical to how people saw the world and religion in a way it wasn't earlier. Second, the cult of relics and saints was, you guessed it, critical in a way it hadn't been earlier. (Think of Mark Twain's remark about there being more shards of the Holy Cross in the world--in the 19th century still!--than there could have been in the actual cross.)  According to Joan herself, people also told stories about a prophecy they associated with her and a tree/forest near her home in Domremy. But in her own words, what people said to her about this was just linked to her performing wonders. This probably included a miraculous power to heal, which was also heavily tied to holy women/living saints in late Middle Ages. (There are stories about men, women, and children all trying to touch Joan, which seems suspiciously, I don't know, *biblical*. And yes, at a time when there was much more preaching of the Bible directly.)   The tree was associated with fairies and local children performed May Crowning-type playing/ritual activities around it, although Joan insists she never believed any of it and never engaged in a lot of the behaviors her judges asked her about. Of course, they lie WILDLY when they write up the articles of condemnation. On one hand, they say Joan admitted to various things when she categorically had not. On the other, though, they exaggerate the various behaviors and beliefs they had asked her about earlier. And, unsurprisingly, they exaggerate according to particular patterns that align with the question of fake or real, demonic or divine.  So people associated Joan with the general performance of miracles and wonders.  **Hans B\u00f6hm**  Okay, obviously a man, obviously German, and not obviously a few decades after Joan. However, B\u00f6hm is a crucial parallel for a few reasons. Even venturing further into the very slowly increasing fear of witches, B\u00f6hm--a shepherd from Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg--essentially launched an entire revolt against unjust conditions based on his own prophecies and visions of Mary.  People were ready to heed prophecy that called to them--and did.  **Conclusion**  Joan was awesome; she promoted her awesomeness; she did so in a way that grew out of the religious culture in which she lived and believed.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 12673.0, "score_ratio": 1.9711934156}

Your question is based on a common misconception about the Victorian period, so I\u2019m going to spend some time debunking that misconception and then try to explain why perfectly reasonable people believe it.   The Victorian period did not represent a sudden rupture from the past with regards to sexuality. Same sex desire and homosexuality and sex outside of marriage were taboo to differing degrees in different times and places in Western culture for centuries. The Victorians did not just up and decide that sex was bad outside of nowhere.   However, this is not to say that the Victorians didn\u2019t differ from the generations immediately preceding them in some ways. One important development of the Victorian period was its heavy emphasis on domesticity. For the Victorians, the home and the family were paramount, the basis of the superior British civilization. The home was an oasis protected from the harsh outside world, a place of comfort where you can rest with your loved ones. Note that this ideal of the home and the family is not so different from how we as a culture think of homes and families today. However, for the Victorians, this idea of the home carried with it a hierarchy, with the husband and father as the head of house, the wife and mother as caretaker of the home (the \"Angel in the House,\" as one famous poem called it), both working to bring up well-adjusted, successful children.  Of course, people before the Victorians had homes and families and valued these things highly. The Victorians didn\u2019t invent the family. What shifted was the importance of the family as a social category that needed to be protected and conceptions of public vs private life. On one hand, the nineteenth century saw, for respectable middle class people, the home was a private sphere, secluded from the world and with significantly more privacy within the home than had been available in previous centuries. Privacy has its own earlier history and development that other users can speak to better than me; for our purposes it\u2019s enough to say that the domestic sphere was supposed to be private.   I say this with the caveat that I\u2019m describing middle class people here; the working classes often lived in very different conditions. This cult of domesticity was very much a phenomenon of the middle class, who set themselves up as the upright, respectable contrast to the stereotypical image of the profligate and licentious aristocrat that had been promoted in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century as the rake or the libertine.   However, there is a contradiction in the Victorian family in that domesticity was also often the subject of public performance. We can argue that this phenomenon is reflected best at the top of society with Queen Victoria herself. Victoria navigated the contradiction of being a woman monarch. Women are supposed to be the Angel in the House, master of the private sphere, not involved in public life. To reconcile this, Victoria made a public performance of being the nation's exemplary mother\u2014utterly devoted to her husband and many, many children. Victoria and Albert were a model of Victorian domestic life, but this model was also very publicly performed.", "human_ref_B": "Hey there,  If you've come to the thread and are wondering why there's no answer yet: we have found that it takes an average of 9 hours for a good answer to appear on a popular thread - properly researching and writing an answer takes time.

As one might expect, for such a politically charged and relevant question it becomes *really* difficult to separate history proper from politics.   One reasonable way to approach the question is to look at what the leaders of the revolution thought and how they preceived or justified authoritarianism. It's also important to understand their political experience and context.   A good starting point I think is the late 19th century, when the Second International, an association of primarily Marxist parties across Europe, suffered an internal crisis between *reformists* and *revolutionists*. At that point, the revolutionary character of Marxism was not yet agreed upon among its followers, and within the parties reformist Marxists tended to hold sway. Unlike modern social democrats, these reformists still (if only nominally) held the ultimate goal of overcoming capitalism; the major disagreement was if this could be achieved by working entirely within the bourgeois state. This question of reform or revolution is discussed with some more historical context in the revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg's eponymous pamphlet, written at the height of this conflict. Eduard Bernstein's works give the reformist perspective.  (As an aside, Rosa Luxemburg was a revolutionist in Germany and Poland who collaborated extensively with Lenin. She would later disagree tactically with Lenin during the Russian revolution but, as I believe, they had no fundamental doctrinal differences-- one can expect that Luxemburg's comments about reform and revolution are broadly the same as Lenin's)  As Europe approached the First World War, the reformist tendency within socialist parties would deepen and even take on a nationalistic character. By then, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) had become the dominant socialist party within Europe, having achieved significant labor reforms and boasting a membership in the millions. This, combined with the threat of invasion from a deeply reactionary Russia, compelled German reformists to associate socialism with German patriotism, and national defense with the defense of socialism (ironically, a similar trend would occur in France *against* Germany, which many Frenchmen perceived as a reactionary threat against their republic). Revolutionists, on the other hand, tended to have an internationalist outlook, believing that only an international revolution against imperialist warfare could defend socialism.  When WW1 broke out at last, the SPD (and most other European parties) voted in favor of war, beginning a period of *Burgfriedenspolitik* wherein the SPD abstained from strikes and other subversive activities against the war effort. The revolutionists and few reformists who disagreed with this policy splintered away from the SPD into the Independent SPD, the Spartacist League, and eventually the German Communist Party. Notably, Lenin's party in Russia also opposed war by majority, foreshadowing the dominance of revolutionists in the upcoming struggle.  This is all to say that the events leading up to WW1 and the Russian revolution precipitated huge, seemingly irreconciliable divisions between the reformist and revolutionist factions of the European socialists. This conflict would take on its most bloody form in the 1918-19 Spartacus uprising at the end of the German revolution: once in power, the now wholly reformist SPD would brutally crush their revolutionist counterparts as they attempted to establish worker's states. Remember again that these were former comrades who, decades ago, would have relied on each other's cooperation.  So what does this have to do with authoritarianism in Russia? The leaders of the Russian revolution were internationalists, and had counted on the victory of the German revolutionaries and, hence, the victory of a sweeping revolution across the world. The hope was that, since Germany was among the foremost industrial powers of the world, it could provide material necessities and alleviate the stresses of war, in turn allowing for demilitarization and democratization across both Germany and Russia. This didn't happen-- again, the German revolutionaries were massacred by reformists. It's possible that the Bolsheviks miscalculated, or simply that the Bolsheviks had no other choice but to push forward and *hope* that Germany would turn around. Probably both. In any case, the ascendant Bolsheviks were left in a very, *very* difficult situation: they were in charge of a war-weary nation with hostile states (particularly now Germany) on all sides and powerful counterrevolutionaries within. Realistically there was only one thing they could do besides capitulate-- dig in, and use the full power of the state to survive for as long as possible.  Rosa Luxemburg summarizes this impasse pretty well in The Russian Tragedy (which is short but extremely useful in understanding the attitudes of communists at the time -- a must read!):  > The awkward position that the Bolsheviks are in today, however, is, together with most of their mistakes, a consequence of basic insolubility of the problem posed to them by the international, above all the *German*, proletariat. To carry out the dictatorship of the proletariat and a socialist revolution in a single country surrounded by reactionary imperialist rule and in the fury of the bloodiest world war in human history \u2013 that is squaring the circle. Any socialist party would have to fail in this task and perish \u2013 whether or not it made self-renunciation the guiding star of its policies. ... **Such is the false logic of the objective situation: any socialist party that came to power in Russia today must pursue the wrong tactics so long as it, as part of the international proletarian army, is left in the lurch by the main body of this army.**  As an example of \"wrong tactics,\" Trotsky discusses in a report that the early Soviet worker's militia could not confront the vastly better-equipped and better-trained German army, nor even the relatively more experienced armies under White control. As a result, Trotsky was compelled to professionalize the army, institute harsh drafts, and even incorporate captured White officers at gunpoint just to win the civil war. Both he and Lenin recognized that these measures were counter to the principles of the revolution but were nonetheless necessary if the revolution were to survive at all.  As we now know, neither Germany nor any comparably industrialized country underwent a successful communist revolution. The Soviets would remain isolated long after Lenin's death, and Stalin would further entrench authoritarianism-- what started as emergency measures became standard procedure when the emergency never went away. (EDIT: This part feels a bit insufficient. I don't want to attribute the entrenchment of authoritarianism as something unique to Stalin as a person -- it was likely a combination of broad social forces and personality. I might point to the rising nationalism in Marxist reformists are an analogous process, but this would require a more detailed treatment of Stalin I am not really prepared to make.)  For subsequent revolutions, the \"fruit from a poisoned tree\" situation you described is sort of right-- these revolutions drew explicitly from Lenin's revolutionary measures and, sometimes less explicitly, from Stalin's entrenchment. One might even say that they were all part of a single, broader revolution, and can't be treated as isolated cases. Later on certain countries like Cambodia and North Korea would spin off on their own and abandon communism even in name, but since they faced the same problems of political isolation, they had at least an excuse to remain authoritarian.   It's probably not true that failure was inevitable, which would ignore the later history of Trotskyism and other oppositional forces in, most notably, the USSR and the China. But I don't want to spin off into counterfactuals-- things *could* have happened differently, but they didn't, and that's the question you're asking.  In summary:  * Pre-WW1 politics caused a deep rift between reformist and revolutionary factions in European socialism  * This led to the (short-term) success of the Russian revolution and the failure of the German revolution, as reformists were much more powerful in the latter country  * Without German support, the Russian Bolsheviks had to enact emergency authoritarian measures to remain afloat  * Later, the static international situation allowed authoritarianism to be entrenched  * Future revolutions would emulate the Bolsheviks and in turn face the same problems of political isolation  Note again that this is just a single perspective, taking into account mostly primary sources from the leaders of the Russian and German revolutions. Still, this is an important point of view I think, and the one I'm most familiar with.

If they \"paid you in exposure\" and sent their (possibly more solvent) friends to you to buy suits or dresses, you might let it slide for a little while, just to be neighborly and keep the peace. But if you were doing House of Worth work for pawnshop pay, you'd eventually get fed up. You'd start sending duns/debt collectors to knock on their door, hoping the annoyance and potential shame would convince them to pony up. At this point, he might contract with a moneylender for a promissory note; the lender would pay you and charge Dastardly interest, and Dastardly would be out of your hair.  If your debtor doesn't find a way to pay you, your next step is prosecution. You want Sir Richard to actually show up for the trial, so you bring legal action against him and pay a shilling for an arrest warrant. A sheriff's officer serves the warrant and will take Sir Richard Dastardly to a sponging house. There, you have some time to settle or you'll end up on trial/in jail.  If it gets to trial, and Dastardly is found to be a debtor, they stick him in jail. You can't just take his stuff, however, not yet -- he still has to decide to pay you, by selling his own stuff or borrowing money from family and friends. Rawdon Crawley never gets to this point, but a number of Dickens characters did. Usually, if you ended up in debtor's prison, you were already poor--not a Sir Richard Dastardly. Typically, a person with a title would have resources: they could sell land, a horse, beg Auntie for cash, or marry some wealthy heiress. If you were poor and in debtor's prison, you did have some light at the end of the tunnel: you could still ply certain trades from within prison, and you could eventually hope to get out. But it was miserable and difficult to drag oneself out of that debt hole. (Imprisonment for debt was abolished in 1869.)  Now, as to your question, \"Did they care?\" I think they cared about as much as we do. Victorians were a little more moralistic than we are now in that they were generally more likely to judge their neighbors as \"bad\" than put the circumstance ahead of their judgment -- but a lot of their attitudes are similar to today's. Being a serial debtor was more personal to the Victorians than it is to us, because there were, with the possible exception of the East India Company, no giant faceless monolithic companies to which you would owe money. You'd owe money to Bob the tailor and Joe the greengrocer, guys who lived probably within a few miles' radius of your own house, not to MasterCard. No one goes hungry if you don't pay MasterCard, but a Victorian person refusing to make good on his debts was literally taking money away from his neighbors, which was a bad look. Tongues would start wagging when the debt collectors came knocking, and a Sir Richard type might find himself not invited to as many parties as before. If he had romantic prospects, they could dry up: the father of a young lady isn't going to want his daughter hooking up with a spendthrift who'll end up in prison and will be unable or unwilling to provide for his family. If he's part of a gentleman's club, depending on how bad his money woes are (and whether or not all the other men in his club have similar attitudes towards money), he could find himself kicked out.   There were jerks, con men, liars, and people who had \"f-you\" amounts of money where they could gleefully skip town on Bob the Tailor and not care. There were no credit scores in the time period, but all you had was your name. If you developed a reputation as a sketchball, tailors wouldn't want to do work for you on credit anymore--no matter who you were. Tailors for the most part couldn't afford to give their work away for free. You'd have to pay cash. If you had cash, this wouldn't actually be a big deal, which is why a lot of wealthier people might only care about their debts insofar as their reputation could be affected. If Bob didn't want to play ball anymore, they'd just pay Bob the cash and get credit from some other poor slob. If you didn't have cash, this would be a serious issue for you. Some \"wealthy\" people didn't actually have \"ready money,\" only large fixed assets like land or houses, which they would then have to mortgage or sell if they'd tanked their reputation/credit, or who were known to be out of money even if they'd never had a debt problem.

Political alliances in large parts of the world during the ancient and medieval periods (and metal ages) were often sealed with marriages. I am struggling to understand why this was important - how does being married to someone's relative make a king less likely to attack them, or more likely to support them during a war? Especially during a period when women held little political power in their own right and a substantial portion of marriages were basically loveless?  Would these alliances have been weaker in the absence of a marriage? Why? Didn't people break them when convenient all the time anyway?  (I know the institution is different depending on region and age. Please, feel free to answer with regards to whichever historical periods you have the most familiarity with.

We in fact have people of the time tell us this: the Tokugawa, through marriage alliances, were able to grab enough allies to win control of Japan in 1600. So they included in their first set of laws issued in 1615 to all other daimy\u014ds that there would be no marriages between warrior families without the Sh\u014dgun's approval (the Tokugawa themselves violated the same edict left in Hideyoshi's will). And in case someone important thought it didn't apply to them, in 1635 the law was clarified to include not only daimy\u014ds but their immediate retainers and division heads. They were that scared marriage alliances would form power blocks to make a mess of things.  I would also like to add some things not mentioned in their great answers to the question linked above: the marriage also acted as a fantastic insurance policy.  First, if the alliance really were going to be broken, likely family correspondences would offer the earliest warnings. A famous, albeit apocryphal, story has Nobunaga's sister Oichi warning him his brother-in-law had betrayed him by sending Nobunaga a sack of beans tied up on both sides. While apocryphal, it's not improbable that Oichi did send Nobunaga some sort of warning. Even if not, we have another example Takeda Shingen's daughter-in-law was from the Imagawa clan. When Shingen decided he would backstab the Imagawa, his son supposedly plotted to assassinate him. Shingen had forced his son to divorce his daughter-in-law, strip his son of the position as heir to the clan, and execute a few ranking vassals. The poor young man was placed under house arrest for two years in a temple where he died. So while in this case the marriage alliance was not successful, consider the length to which the son was willing to defy his father to try to hold it together tells us the marriage definitely strengthened ties. Having no doubt heard about the entire thing and the death of his brother-in-law, the Imagawa daimy\u014d requested Shingen send him back his sister, which Shingen complied. Only over a year later did Shingen invade the Imagawa. So the entire ordeal gave the Imagawa at least three years of warning. They still lost but it's not the marriage's fault.  Second, *even if* things do come to war with one side getting beat, your family/in-laws would likely offer mercy or beg for mercy on your behalf. In his rise to power in central Asia, Timor pardoned most Amirs whom he had a marriage alliance with but later came to blows. Likewise, in my area to use one of countless examples, the H\u014dj\u014d clan went up against Hideyoshi and lost Hideyoshi basically ordered the clan's complete destruction, but the life of the final H\u014dj\u014d daimy\u014d Ujinao was spared because he was the son-in-law of Tokugawa Ieyasu as the H\u014dj\u014d and the Tokugawa had a marriage alliance and Ieyasu begged for Ujinao's life to Hideyoshi. Ujinao's punishment was decreased to taking his buddhist vows to become a monk, and within a few years he was pardoned and became a daimy\u014d again (albeit with a tiny fief).  Third, marriages themselves were insurance policies through the ties they create. In 1600 when the M\u014dri/Ishida side were going to war with the Tokugawa, the Sanada were caught in the middle because they had marriage alliances with both sides. What the Sanada did was decide to \"split\" in two, have a mock fight among themselves, and when the dust settled between the others the half that sided with the winners begged for mercy on behalf of the half that sided with the losers. In this case it was successful, but even if it wasn't at least half the family would have survived with their political powers intact (the winning half was given the realm of the loosing half, so no net change). And to be sure the Sanada weren't the only one to pull this trick.  Finally, even if all else fails, and the family is completely destroyed by the alliance breaking, hopefully the blood will live on through the son/daughter's offspring.  Note this is just about the strength of the alliance itself, and nothing about the familial ties and inheritance opportunities marriages create.  Also saying a substantial portion of marriages were loveless is likely a false modern bias. There are plenty of loveless marriages today and I see no proof there were proportionally more in history. Even if true, we have *plenty* of accounts and evidence of loving marriages.", "human_ref_B": "There have been some more recent answers on this, see for instance this by u/mimicofmodes and this by u/somecrazynerd", "labels": 1, "seconds_difference": 12767.0, "score_ratio": 4.1666666667}

In the late 9th century? Or, around the turn of the millennium (so-called \"Late/ Second Viking Age)?    If the former is indeed the case, the situation would have been much closer to that of Iceland, discussed by /u/glasgallow and linked by /u/BookQueen13 below. It was not until the middle of the 10th century that now Denmark saw somewhat stable, unified (and supra-local) polity in form of Jelling dynasty after the collapse of the Godfred-Horik dynasty around the middle of the 9th century.     On the other hand, if OP ('s supposed war veteran) lived under the reigns of the Jelling rulers like Svend Forkbeard or Cnut the Great, he (as a war veteran, I primarily regard the Dane in question as \"him\" in order not to go into the details on the woman's legal capacity in Viking Age and Medieval Danish laws) might get interfered by the superior authority beyond the local society level like these kings.    Another possibly (and most probably) problematic premise in OP's question is the assumption that he the Dane ex-Viking] could use press his claim by resorting almost solely to the practice of *holmgang* with ease there either in the late 9th century or in the 10/11th centuries.    The study of conflict settlement in medieval Europe (including Scandinavia and Iceland) has advanced greatly especially since 1970s, with help of the anthropological approach as well as feud study, initiated early in the 20th century by Otto Brunner. From their point of view, the use of violence and the judicial process were not dichotomous (mutually exclusive), but often complemented each other to reach an agreement between both parties involved with - that now we regard as an primary goal of a series of conflicts.    As for the social meaning of not unlimited/ ritual use of violence in early medieval society (though not in Viking Age Scandinavia in a narrow sense), I also recommend you to check /u/EndOfTheWorldGuy's recent post in: [Was the need to go to great lengths to defend ones honor as vain as we perceive it today in our modern times? How important was it to gain and protect honor besides the obvious reasons of ego?.   Another trend since 1970s that has affected the alleged importance of *holmgang*, or the legal text recorded later on medieval parchments in general, is a revisionism in the character of medieval Scandinavian law books (codes). These law texts had often been regarded as a residue (or at least including residue layer) of the Viking Age society and sometimes used for the comparative analysis to reconstruct the distant past, but now more and more scholars got used to analyze them primarily as the product of a social change in later times, especially the High Middle Ages when these texts were codified (, though a few scholars has countered this revisionist trend further now).   The majority of study on the *holmgang* had been published until 1970s - thus belonged to the older (now dated) approach of conflict settlement as well as the legal culture of the Viking Age Scandinavia. In other words, less and less scholars are now not so sure about the possibility that Viking Age Scandinavians actually practiced *holmgang* to settle the conflict widely, exact as specified in one of High Medieval Swedish lawbooks as well as some sagas of the Icelanders.   Aside from these two changing trend of research as well as the essential primary texts, however, we mainly have two more problems to take OP's case into consideration:    1. As Vogt remarks, we have not so ideal- or very limited amount of primary sources for the study on the judicial practice in Medieval Denmark. Almost no court record is extant until the end of the 14th century, and almost no record of judgement for whole the Middle Ages (prior to the Reformation in Denmark in 1536) (Vogt 2014: 185f.).   1. While medieval Danes almost certainly knew the concept of *holmgang* itself, we rely mainly on one specific person - Saxo Grammaticus for Viking Age Denmark. 13th century lawbooks don't explicitly refer to the *holmgang* as a judicial practice at all.    +++    Then, what Saxo (about 1200) says about the *holmgang*, or exactly speaking, its abolition?    Saxo mentions duels across the first half of his work (legendary pre-history part), but not so much in his latter, history (10th/ 11th century onward) part. He actually mentions its abolition twice, in somewhat contradictory manners:    1. At the time of conversion of King Svend Forkbeard by Poppo's ordeal (around the turn of the millennium) (Saxo, X-xl-4, in: Christiansen trans. 1980: 21): \".....The Danes abolished the custom of judicial duelling, and that decreed that various cases should be settled by this kind of ordeal.\"   1. For the second time, Saxo ascribes the total eradication of the practice of judicial combats under the reign of King Harald Hen (r. 1074/76-80), as he comments as following (Saxo XI-x-7, in: Christiansen trans. 1980: 72): \"For it seems to posterity that law-disputes are better settled by swearing than by steel.\"    For me, these accounts suggest that Saxo certainly regarded the trial \"by steel\" (judicial combat) somewhat as archaic way of settlement, but we cannot know the details of former practices only based on these accounts alone.    +++    Provincial codes from the 13th century generally specify the testimony with oath by the respected person in the district as a means to settle the problem, and I wonder whether similar way could have also been taken before in some cases.   To give an example, *The Law of Jutland (1241 CE)* stipulates on the boundaries between the field as following:    >\"If men disagree about boundaries between fields, then men of truth of the district shall mark it with stakes or with stones and thereafter swear at that place where there is disagreement that they have done it rightly. If it is both on the boundary between fields and between districts that they disagree, then four from one district and four from the other districts, those that live closest, shall decide and swear according to what they know most truthfully they have done it right, and then make it public at the assembly. But if there is any memory that it had been sworn to before, and any man is alive of those who swore, then it shall not be sworn to again. But if there is no memory that it had been sworn to before, and the king will have the boundaries settled by riding, then it will also fully stand; however, he must not come without notice so that it is secret to some of those who are parties in the dispute. It is safer that the boundary between the fields be sworn to than ridden, the those know best who live the closest.....(*The Law of Jutland*, II-21, English translation is taken from: [Tamm & Vogt trans. 2016: 261f.].\"     If similar system was applied to the conflict settlement for OP's case, the personal connection either with local or with the external political authority must have played an important role - since the king should also appoint \"men of truth\" (*The Law of Jutland*, II-1~4, Tamm & Vogt trans. 2016: 258). Before the royal appoint became norm, it is also likely that such a role should have been played by the local elders or possibly the chieftain (perhaps on behalf of the king).      +++    On the other hand, surprisingly enough, it was not until the almost end of the Middle Ages that not only the nobles, but also the peasants sometimes employ the violence as a means to push their claim against their peers (that is to say, peasant vs peasant) in medieval kingdom of Denmark. Denmark did not have a unified kingdom-wide law code like Norway, and the monopoly of violence by the kingship did not easily achieved in practice, researchars argues.

Namely, they were familiar with the slow waters of major rivers (Niger, Senegal and Gambia) and with the coast of modern day Senegambia. Sadly, we lack direct sources about what types of boats were available at that time (14th century) in that particular area (River valleys and Senegambian coast). However, we do have a lot of accounts from european traders from the 16th century onwards, and those are quite useful.     European traders, sailing along the Senegambian coast, quickly found africans (wolofs, serers, mandinkas, bizagos and others) using canoes - some quite large, that could transport cattle - to navigate the ocean. Those canoes lacked sails and depended on the strength of rowers to get somewhere. The fact that the Cape Verde islands (about 600 kilometers from the coast) were uninhabited prior to the arrival of european sailors is strong evidence that the local african canoes didn't get very far into the open sea, prefering coastal areas.     Those canoes were mostly made out a single tree and quite effective at their purpose (i.e. navigate around the coast and into river estuaries), but sometimes more diverse materials would be used.     In the larger and calmer rivers inland, canoes were used as well, but also bigger boats made out of several pieces of wood, capable of carrying lots of people and animals. They, however, also lacked proper sails and relied on people (either rowing or pushing against the riverbed with paddles) or simply the gentle currents of the river.     TL;DR: Basically canoes and boats that lacked sails and, despite their occasional large size, lacked the proper resistance to sustain damage caused by waves or fight sea currents.

Both beliefs have existed simultaneously since ancient times and survive today. Let's start with a look into the origin of the former. When the Israelites were exiled from Palestine by Babylon in the 6th century BCE, returning to that land became a major theme in their scriptures. This is the purpose of Ezekiel's vision of the Valley Of Dry Bones, in which God shows the prophet many dead bodies being returned to their living state and explains that Israel will be restored just so.   After the exile, many exilic biblical passages were reinterpreted as Israel's historical context changed, and in the face of oppression many Jews began to view Ezekiel's vision as a prophecy of a literal, bodily resurrection at the end of time, divine justice for the suffering they faced in life. We see this view in the book of 2 Maccabees (which FYI isn't considered canon by protestants) written in the second century BCE. The author recounts the oppression the Jews faced under the brutal Antiochus Epiphanes, who outlawed Jewish practices under pain of death. In the story, a mother and her seven sons bravely choose to be burned alive rather than renounce their faith, comforted by the knowledge that they will be resurrected to eternal life while Antiochus and his men rot in the ground.   A few centuries later we see a retelling of the same event in the book of 4 Maccabees, but this time the family is reassured not that they will be bodily resurrected, but that their souls will be immediately gathered to God, and that  >We, through this severe suffering and endurance, shall have the prize of virtue and shall be with God, on whose account we suffer; but you, because of your bloodthirstiness toward us, will deservedly undergo from the divine justice eternal torment by fire. (4 Mac 9:8-9)  For this author it is the soul that matters rather than the body, and since God is eternal, so is his judgment, immediate and everlasting. (The irony of the influence of Platonic philosophy on this author's account of a resistance against Greek culture is apparently lost on him.)   The persecution under Antiochus is the same situation that gave rise to apocalyptic literature like the book of Daniel (2nd century BCE), in which the author assures his reader that God will send \"one like a son of man\" to bring divine destruction onto the ruler and usher in the bodily resurrection and judgment immediately after his death (Daniel 11:45-12:2). The early Christians adapted this framework to Jesus. They believed he was Daniel's \"son of man\" who intervened to conquer death and sin and that his resurrection was the \"first fruits\" of the general resurrection soon to come (1 Corinthians 15:20).  Many believers changed their minds from belief in the resurrection to the belief in immediate spiritual judgment simply because God's physical intervention into history (known as the Kingdom Of God) and ushering in of the resurrection never came. We can see this even in the gospel of Luke, when Jesus tells the man being crucified next to him \"today you will be with me in Paradise.\" The evangelist even tells his readers not to expect the Kingdom Of God to come, but rather know that it resides inside them (Luke 17:21). Compare this to the other gospels in which Jesus assures his followers that the earthly Kingdom Of God is soon to come indeed (Matthew 24:30-34).  Plenty of Christians today believe in a synthesis of both immediate spiritual judgment and a bodily resurrection at the end of time. This belief goes back to the book of 4 Ezra, in which the eponymous Israelite leader is told by an angel that spiritual torment and paradise begin immediately after death, but that there is also a coming bodily resurrection, at which point the righteous will enjoy everlasting life and the wicked will finally be destroyed forever.

The first is that the idea of violence in the American West is very different in reality than it is as portrayed in popular media. I've written elsewhere about the most popular visual representation of this, the 'duel at high noon', which is almost entirely absent from the historical record despite being the climactic showdown of countless dime novels and films, but looking more broadly too, while that isn't to say the West *wasn't* violent, it certainly wasn't lawless. Historiography since the 1970s or so has mostly pushed back against the idea of the \"Wild, Wild West\", even if the public mind hasn't, and continues to relish the image.   In any case though, body counts get exaggerated in the retelling, and that is assuming the best of intentions. Much of Dodge City's infamous reputation was created from whole cloth by Stuart Lake who did a supposedly \"as-told-to\" autiobiography of Wyatt Earp which quotes liberally from primary sources that never existed to describe dozens of deaths that never happened, while in reality its \"wild days\" were limited to the first year or so of settlement. Similarly Montana Territory was claimed to have over 100 murders by the editor Thomas Dimsdale, but the reality is often much duller. Scholarly assessment of the period substantiates eight in that time frame. Similarly, take a place such as Deadwood, a well known locale for its lack of any actual law enforcement during its initial settlement and most famously represented in the show of the same name... which only experienced 4 murders in that first year of settlement-without-law enforcement - possibly less than a single episode of the show, although it has been ages since I watched it. Returning to Dodge city though, when one year the city experienced a total of 5 murders, this was heralded as a \"civic disaster\", the highest total the city experienced aside from its first year of habitation in 1872 when the entirety of its wild reputation was earned, with slightly over a dozen homicides of all types (murder, self-defense, manslaughter).  Now to be sure, looking at raw numbers tells only half the tale, and it is homicide rates can tell us another side. 5 deaths in a population of 600 is a much bigger deal than a population of 6 million, after all, but as they say, it is pretty easy to lie with statistics. If I told you that the homicide rate in Dodge City was 100.4 per 100,000 (the US was 5.3 per 100,000 in 2016 for comparison) in 1880, that would seem shocking... but if I told you a single person was murdered that year, it would seem considerably less so! The population that year was only 996, and the death of Henry Heck at the hands of John Gill was the sole difference between a murder rate of 0 and 100. This is quite important in understanding how murder was viewed in the period, as the difference in *rates* seems high, but was likely quite unconcerning to the population when it was a difference of only one, two, or maybe three people.  Now to be sure, this doesn't exactly answer your question, but I preface all of this to say that when we are talking about murder in the American West, we're talking about very small numbers. A sheriff in many towns might never even have to draw his gun in his career, and even in a \"violent\" place like Dodge City, the coroner was being called out a few times per year. Lawmen would be much more likely to be hunting down horse thieves and cattle rustlers, which happened at a great deal high rate. Dykstra's \"Quantifying the Wild West\" and \"To Live and Die in Dodge City\" are both useful for a good deal more statistical analysis stuff, which is interesting, but not what we need to dive into here.  Now, let us say that someone has been murdered. The location isn't terribly important, but let's follow the case of Lincoln County, Nebraska as that is what I have sources on, although this is really quite equally applicable to most settled areas, lawmen and legal systems being present and generally followed in any town or city of any noticeable size.   Anyways, for starters, often the sheriff or his deputies needed to do next to nothing when someone was killed, not because of the evidence, but because they would turn themselves in. Claims of justification or self-defense were fairly common, the law about it permissive, and assuming prosecutors even thought to go through with it, juries were not unsympathetic. In the strange perspective of the West, murder wasn't even seen as the worst crime - horse thieves often enjoyed worse sentences - and *how* one dealt with the killing, presenting their actions as honorable and correct, could go a long way. Will Hale, for instance, murdered several people in 1870s Texas, the first a man who hat been cheating at cards, and then following that his brothers when they attempted to exact their revenge. The first killing was likely unjustified by the law, but prosecutors didn't feel it worth going after, and the latter ones were considered self-defense so given a pass as well.  Especially if there were no witnesses, a homicide committed in private could be presented as the killer was able to justify it, but even with several, if the victim 'had it coming' prosecutorial discretion would often let it slide and leave many murders unindicted. Only a total of four murders in Lincoln County during the 1870-1900 period actually proved to require real investigation by law enforcement, lacking witnesses to name a suspect, and these perhaps speak to the core of your question here.  The most interesting case is that of the murder of Kate Manning, killed at her land claim in 1871, a very clear execution by single gunshot. A sheriff and deputy were called and found footprints which they took plaster molds of. Comparison with suspects showed that her own brother, Peter, matched due to a deformity of the foot and he was brought to trial. What is important here is that he was found not guilty. Maintaining his innocence, we can easily presume that the jury didn't find a brother visiting his sister to be compelling enough evidence to go beyond 'reasonable doubt', although my efforts to find the trial documents for State v. Manning failed so we can't say for certain (Records are here just presumably not digitized). In 1871, Loyal Bly was found murdered but a lack of an clues at the scene meant there was nothing to go on. A more successful case, regarding the death of a cowboy, was solved when the murderer turned out to be a fellow cowboy he had worked with and not gotten along with.  To in short there, how would you get away with murder in the \"Wild West\"? Don't have any witnesses, and don't be the person with the most motive. Circumstantial evidence could, at least in the case of Manning, be explained away, and if there was nothing at the scene of the crime at all, it would likely be a dead end for investigation, especially lacking modern forensics. Lacking clues the only real avenue was checking to see \"Who might have wanted them dead?\" and if you weren't that person, you probably could get away with it scott free.   A side note of course can be made here, namely that the courts themselves and the court of public opinion were different beasts. Attempts to lynch suspects before trials were not unheard of, especially if the victim was popular, young, or female. Manning was nearly subjected to one for instance, and it was common to move the venue of a trial, both for the safety of the accused lest a mob conspire to take him, and also to ensure a more impartial jury. So in any case, the point here is that even if you might be \"Not Guilty\" by standards of the court, being caught at all could have its dangers no matter your confidence in acquittal. But the larger picture, really, should be that murders weren't that common, and real \"Who Dunnits\" were quite few and far between.  **Sources**  Dykstra, Robert R. \"Quantifying the Wild West: The Problematic Statistics of Frontier Violence\" *Western Historical Quarterly* 40 (Autumn 2009): 321-347  -- \"To Live and Die in Dodge City: Body Counts, Law and Order, and the Case of Kansas v.

We tried to correct the issue and hopefully it will work better now", "human_ref_B": "I think for most of us in the West, it's easy to slip into seeing \"colonize and evangelize\" as the default setting. Our Western Civ II/World Civ II class *starts* with that as the foundational principle in its triumphant Story Of Civilization. In fact, with a variety of exceptions, Christianity and Islam had spent a solid number of centuries quite comfortably expanding through attrition in conquered territories. The ideal of evangelizing militancy in what John O'Malley has dubbed \"Early Modern Catholicism\" is exceptional--not the other way around. And to a much greater extent than our textbooks like to admit, *successful* militant evangelization was an even further exception.  Christian Europeans had spent the fifteenth century making, well, European Christianity. It was the Church's first full-court press to teach *everyone* in Christian society the basic fundamentals of what now had a name: \"the Christian faith.\" That's not to overblow the 14th century as \"pagan\" or whatever, just to stress how *dedicated* large swathes of the 15th century Church were to religious instruction of the laity. The Ten Commandments, the seven deadly sins, the meaning of the sacraments, how to die a good death so you go to heaven, reading the Bible (in the vernacular...except in England) to your family after a post-Mass meal, &c.  Individual-level religious enthusiasm is a big part of this in many cases, from leaders on down. It was especially aided by an utterly ubiquitous belief that the world was going to end RIGHT NOW...no, NOW...no, but that's *definitely* the Antichrist over there. It makes the looming Day of Judgment very real and very soon. It's easy to bleed this over into *collective* religious enthusiasm--the desire to save other people's souls, too.  There are other factors in play, especially the inexorable onward march of the medieval push towards order in society. Sumptuary laws regulating what people of different social statuses are and aren't allowed to wear is a very visible example. Religion is another big one, though. You'll recall that other thing that happened in 1492--Isabella and Ferdinand forced all Jewish Spaniards to choose between conversion to Christianity or immediate exile. This isn't *just* anti-Semitism for the sake of anti-Semitism, although it's that too; subsequent actions of Spanish inquisitors put in action the often-stated paranoia that Jewish people will sneakily de-convert New Christians. A big threat to Church and state authority!  So we head into the sixteenth century with Western Europe tipping into *internal* militant evangelization. You can then think of Martin Luther and his rinkadink regional Reformation as one among many contemporary reform movements. Several of those being, as traditional in medieval Christianity, *reformacio* of monastic life. Most relevantly here, that means the creation of the Jesuits and Ursulines, and the streamlining and outward turn of Observant mendicant orders. In addition to personal, internal spiritual renewal, the new and revived orders aimed to really, REALLY get Christians to be, well, Christian, and in a more sober and knowledgeable way than some of the more colorful aspects of late medieval devotion.  *Now* we can pitch this into wider context. The Church had long seen itself as an international government, operating within and beyond secular ones. Participation in colonialist expansion to the west and south and very east was important to it for mundane reasons as well as spiritual ones. One strategy absolutely was to plant convents of European nuns (especially) and monks as a way of claiming territory. But the other was to try to convert Indigenous populations to Christianity as an extension of the way Europe was being \"converted.\"  And that's the happy triumphant success narrative, and we point to modern Mexican Catholicism and the recent canonization of Kateri Tekakwitha and say, \"Sounds plausible.\" In reality, there were a whole lot of jagged steps forwards and backwards. You're probably familiar with That Ugly Time Europeans Decided To Formally Debate Whether Indigenous Americans Are Human, a question intimately wrapped up with whether they should be targets for conversion or not.   In some cases, Christianity blended into native religion and native religion blended into Christianity. Sometimes this *didn't* happen, and colonialist Inquisitors thought it had anyway and persecuted Americans for witchcraft. In Catholic Europe, meanwhile, the Inquisition was frequently targeting people it identified as \"crypto-Jews\"--essentially, people they believed were adopting a veneer of Christianity while retaining their non-Christian religion for keeps. We're talking about an Early Modern Catholicism here, not mission versus home Christianity. And sometimes, friars kind of just shrugged and said maybe mission wasn't really that important to the Church in the first place.  European imperialist expansion happened at a very specific time in western religious history. To be a Christian had become *defined as* more than just baptism and reciting the right words at your godchildren's baptisms; making a territory Christian needed to mean more than mass baptism or even baptism of the leaders. Whether imperialist conquest, diplomatic encounter (hi, China!), or cleaning up one's own backyard, the making of Christians was of primary importance to large segments of the Catholic Church.  They had the money, the power, and the government support in the interests of order and control to back up their mission of saving souls with the apocalypse just over the horizon.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 8794.0, "score_ratio": 5.7173913043}

This did not keep Christianity from spreading to the non-Jewish populations of the Mediterranean.    The aforementioned Paul then wrote many letters to these communities in which there were some serious issues of dietary restrictions and male circumcision were very divisive topics between Jewish and Gentile Christians.  In what I believe to be a nice political move, it is decided that there should be no pressure for Christians to be circumcised or to have restrictions on food (the once restriction that I remember at all is to not eat of food offered in sacrifice to idols i.e. Roman or other \"gods\").  This is just one example of the inclusiveness of the early Christian Church.  A major part of the \"success\" of Christianity is/was it's adaptability.", "human_ref_B": "There's evidence of 'factionalism' even among the earliest Christians (in the 1st century) on this very issue. In many cases, much of the tension arose between Jewish and Gentile Christians. But not necessarily. One of the narratives in the New Testament itself that addresses dietary issues (and some of the Christian innovations regarding them) is found in the 10th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles:  >Peter went up on the roof to pray. 10 He became hungry and wanted something to eat; and while it was being prepared, he fell into a trance. 11 He saw the heaven opened and something like a large sheet coming down, being lowered to the ground by its four corners. 12 In it were all kinds of four-footed creatures and reptiles and birds of the air. 13 Then he heard a voice saying, \"Get up, Peter; kill and eat.\" 14 But Peter said, \"By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is profane or unclean.\" 15 The voice said to him again, a second time, \"What God has made clean, you must not call profane.\"   This is almost certainly more representative of the so-called \"supersessionist\" branch, which prioritized the coming/sacrifice of Christ and its transformative effects over observance of Jewish law.  We can see another narrative that addresses kosher/dietary things, just a few chapters later (in Acts 15). Described here is a \"council\" in Jerusalem, with many the most important Christian figures present: James, Peter, Paul. In the end, these figures produce a letter which is then sent to Gentiles churches, advising that Gentiles should \"abstain . . . from things polluted by idols and from fornication and from whatever has been strangled and from blood.\" This list is virtually identical to that in Leviticus 17-18: prohibiting meat offered to idols (17.8-9), ingestion of blood (17.10-12) and improperly slaughtered animals (17.15).  I've written about this in more detail here - but just to pick out one little section:  >there's no real indication from [the council related in Acts 15] that Paul and the Jerusalem church get along anything other than splendidly (\"our dear friend\" Paul, etc.) . . . Yet the letter that they then send back with Paul (to Antioch, Syria, Cilicia) seems to have \"agreements\" which, elsewhere, are quite opposed by Paul. While - for the sake of space - skipping over some nuances here, consider Paul's blanket statement in 1 Cor 10:25-26:  >>Eat *anything* that is sold in the meat market without asking questions for conscience\u2019s sake; \"for the earth is the Lord's, and all it contains\"  ____  Ultimately, as the Christian church became a majority *Gentile* church, the supersessionist 'faction' won out - evidence of which is certainly found in the accounts of Acts themselves (which, as a whole, is a highly fictionalized [quasi-]'history').   It's absolutely fascinating to look at early Islam's relationship with all this. There's some evidence that some of the influence of some of the more primitive Jewish-oriented Christian sects survived, and may have still been around to have influenced Islam (that could be its own thread). But in any case, it all fits in with Islam's portrait of a Christianity which - though still founded by figures that were truly divinely inspired, and worth of reverence - had gone too far in its rejection of the laws and theology of its 'mother' traditions, introducing heretical innovations.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 97.0, "score_ratio": 9.0}

I'll also assume that not all members of the group interacted with Europeans, just that somewhat regular contact/influence existed some time between 1657 and 1717.  The closest nations to Boston, the Wampanoag, Nipmuck, Narragansett and Nashaway, were swept up in the hostilities with King Phillip's War from 1675-1678. Any Native American belligerents not killed in the conflict and not professing Christians were sold into slavery in Bermuda. Praying Indians settled in towns like Natick, Grafton and Marlborough, and refugees fled inland to join other nations.  Expanding out of the direct Boston/Providence Plantation area, we have the nations in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. Coastal populations in Maine would have regular trading contact with white merchants and fisherman, so those nations are out. Further inland many nations possibly contacted a European during King William's War (look, a map] during the 1680s and 1690s. I am not as familiar with the small nations of northern Maine, but I assume the constant tension between the French and English colonial enterprises, and the Maine Amerindians strategic importance as allies, meant they were courted extensively during the period. Further north into Canada the Wendat/Huron were strongly allied with the French, and during the diaspora caused by the Beaver Wars (to be explained shortly) fled west to the Great Lakes.  Looking west, here is a generalized map so we can keep our bearings. The Mahican and the Delaware definitely encountered Europeans in the period of interest. First contact along the Mohawk River occurred in 1609 and these groups were intimately involved in the game of colonial expansion with New York/New England/New France.   1657-1717 is a very interesting time for the Haudenosaunee/Iroquois. Hostilities related to the fur trade and disease mortality brought about a series of mourning wars that increased the Haudenosaunee territory, and wrought destruction over a huge swath of the U.S. Midwest. The Beaver Wars turned the Great Lakes into a war zone. Iroquois raids depopulated much of the U.S. Midwest and sent refugees fleeing to the lands bordering the Great Plains. French missionaries fled west with their Huron flock, establishing missions on Lake Michigan by 1652 and the western tip of Lake Superior by 1661. As they moved west, the Huron diaspora opened up the fur trade to nations previously beyond the frontier outposts. Heading directly west of Boston we are basically on the Great Plains before we consider a nation without European contact.  Next, lets dive south. English colonial enterprises in Pennsylvania contacted the Erie, Shawnee and previously mentioned Iroquois. Jamestown was established in 1607, and English influence continued to grow among the Algonquian nations living in the tidewater. To the west of the tidewater we start to run into the area of Iroquois expansion during the Beaver Wars so I will dive further south.  Between 1657 and 1717,  traders operating out of Virginia and Carolina colonies united the greater U.S. Southeast based on the trade of Indian slaves and deerskins. Though actual \"white guy presence\" was limited, the repercussions of the Indian slave trade destabilized the south. Pressure from the French and English spurred the rise of confederacies like the Creek, Cherokee, Chickasaw and Choctaw to deal with the encroachment of the French to the west (operating from Louisiana and the Mississippi River) and the English (with their native, slave-raiding allies) to the east. As an aside, from 1696-1700 a devastating smallpox epidemic spread through the southeast causing tremendous mortality in the region. Epidemics, combined with refugees fleeing the Yamasee War from 1715-1717, shattered the existing lifeways in the south. The interior southeastern nations, as well as the petite nations along the Gulf Coast, all felt the repercussions of contact with Europeans between 1657 and 1717.  So, we are at the Mississippi and we have yet to encounter a Native American nation without contact with/significant influence from Europeans between 1657 and 1717. Obviously, the nations of New Mexico and Texas near Spanish missions are out of consideration. In New Mexico the Spanish presence along the Rio Grande ensures the Pueblos, Apaches, Utes, Dine, Comanche and many smaller Southwestern nations could contact a white guy. The first mission in Spanish Texas, San Francisco de los Tejas, was established in 1690. The Spanish presence in Texas was not influential, long-lived, or particularly productive during our time period, but it does mean we need to look north of the Red River for a nation that fits our criteria (Edit: The first mission founded in the geographic region that we know as Texas was San Angelo, founded in 1632. Thanks to /u/_choupette for clarifying.)  Where does this leave us? In 1717 you would need to be on the Great Plains, likely north of the Red River, and west of French influence along the Mississippi River/Great Lakes to encounter a Native American nation that had yet to contact a white person. Even then, contact was imminent. For example, the first European encounter with the Mandan occurred with the arrival of a French Canadian trader, Sieur de la Verendrye, in 1738.  **Sources**  Calloway *Once Vast Winter Count: The Native American West Before Lewis and Clark*  Kelton *Epidemics and Enslavement: Biological Catastrophe in the Native Southeast 1492-1715*  Gallay *The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South, 1670-1717*  Bragdon *Native Peoples of Southern New England, 1650-1775*  Trigger *The Children of Aataentsic: A History of the Huron People to 1660*  Weber *The Spanish Frontier in North America*", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 19970.0, "score_ratio": 3.5896226415}

There's no local HR and it's handled at corporate in a different state.   Ok so we had a work truck that the company owned that we'd use to pick up supplies like once or twice a month. It would also be used if anyone needed to make any sort of trip for the company's reasons on company time. Well this week my boss sold it. I'm going to speculate a bit and I can't prove it at all, but I'm like 80% sure he sold it to a friend or family member for cheap. It was a great truck that even I drove a couple times and it didn't have any issues with it so I don't know why he felt like selling it.   Anyway so today we needed to pick up supplies. I'm the only one here that has a truck. Boss walked into my office and told me that if I'm not busy I need to take my truck to pick up supplies or give my keys to my coworker so he can go. I point to the coat rack I have in my office that has my motorcycle jacket and helmet hanging on it and say \"I rode my bike today\" he looked annoyed and just says \"that's going to be a problem\" and walks out of my office. When the weather is good I like to ride my bike and the weather has been amazing here the past couple weeks.   Anyway my boss came back into my office several minutes later telling me to go with my coworker in his car to my house to get my truck so we can go get the supplies. I lied and told him my wife took the truck to her sister's place like 1.5 hours away. He put his hands on his hips and shook his head visibly getting more annoyed. Told me I need to bring my truck in on Monday and he'll let me know ahead of time the next time that we're running low so I can make sure that I bring my truck in.   So I'm really annoyed myself right now. If we needed the company truck why the hell did he sell it?

The CEO is a young woman of about 35 who appears to have some trouble managing expectations, employee workload and customer complaints. A few months back I was working in a 4 person team, and I estimated my workload at around 120% capacity. We dont get paid overtime, but I still worked longer hours in order to keep clients happy. Of the other 3 people in my team, one has since quit, the other went on a long holiday and the third got Covid. Three new very important and time-consuming projects were also added to my workload, which means I'm at around 200% capacity. My absent team members were not replaced, and several clients got seriously upset at the decrease in quality of service.   I started to feel down in the dumps and drained all the time. I talked to my bosses and provided them with a list of my weekly tasks with an estimate of time needed to accomplish each, and it added up to an 80 hour work week. They offered no solution, because apparently no candidates reply to their job offers. I routinely started getting yelled at by clients and my bosses alike whenever the quality of my work was not up to standard. I started sinking lower and lower, and my preexisting anxiety and depression began to take over.  It's 9pm on a Friday and I'm having dinner when I get a call from the CEO. She's screaming mad because a client called her in a rage - I apparently set her a press release formatted in the wrong font. I threw up my dinner. But still, I offered to fix it and send it back asap.

I'm telling you as someone who ended up being let go after giving my entire self to a company with a very similar sounding CEO and bosses - quit. Quitting was something I had thought about but was playing it safe and not willing to quit without a job offer. the thing is, i had no time to do applications or interviews because of my work load. I was tired, I was angry, I would cry constantly. Seeing picture of myself during that time, I look like a dead person walking, and I had only worked there 7 fucking months. I finally was open about how I was feeling in an upfront, direct way: I couldn't take more on, I needed support. I told them that on a Thursday. I was let go the Monday after I said it. It ruined me for at least a year - I found another job quickly enough  but left that one at 2 months in because I just couldnt handle anything. Getting fired was them taking the last bit of me - the sense of ANY control I had was gone because I told myself I would quit and that was the power I had. It was awful.     I'd prepare to resign at that meeting with the COO. I'm telling you it wont get better (and I think you know that).

Don't buy it. The company that fired me kept going downhill after I was let go. My entire team was either fired or left shortly after. The company still exists, the CEO is the same and now years later, It's the most traumatizing experience I've ever had.     Go into the meeting with the COO. Quit your job. Be polite.

Now, this discussion question is partly a response to Camus\u2019 \u201cThe Myth of Sisyphus\u201d. (For those who are unfamiliar) Here, Camus essentially tries to answer one of the most fundamental philosophical questions: Should I commit suicide? Or in other words: Is life worth living? His answer goes something like this: Yes, life is worth living, but it is your responsibility to find meaning in life, and from that meaning it is your responsibility to find happiness (please refute me if you disagree with this summary).   Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, this single philosophical work has changed my life\u2014it is my Bible. However, I disagree that he answers the question on whether life is worth living. I understand that Camus is partly meaning \u201cphilosophical suicide\u201d; this distinction allows his argument and allegory to be sound. But in the beginning, he specifically meant literally ending your life. Since Sisyphus (a man condemned to push a Boulder up a hill for eternity, only for it to fall back down every day) has no option to commit suicide, his only logical option is to simply enjoy his suffering, thus tricking the gods for eternity.   But what if Sisyphus COULD choose to commit suicide (in the Atheist sense) and therefore cease to exist?

While I believe it is generally worthwhile to engage with Hegel's primary source material, you may have specific reasons for your need to engage with Hegel that, given the difficulty of such study, make this a less valuable way to spend your time. For example, if you are really just interested in the influence of Hegel on French thought in the latter half of the 20th century, (e.g. because you want to just understand *those* projects more thoroughly), then you may not *absolutely* need to read Hegel directly -- (however, I would still of course personally recommend it.) The reason for this is that this influence was, by and large, shaped by the readings of Hegel developed by Kojeve and Hyppolite. Still, it might be argued that any adequate understanding of a philosophical project would include recognition of where that project's plausibility (or validity or whatever) depends on *mis*-understanding or only partially understanding some project to which it takes itself to respond. In that case, it may become worthwhile, yet again, to read the original texts of Hegel.   Now, that's just one example, but hopefully it gives a sense of what I mean. There are many good introductory books on Hegel, but a number of them disagree on basic issues. As such, it might be helpful if you provided a little bit more context.

So, the argument between Hard Determinists and Compatibilists is about the necessary conditions for Free Will.   Some people think this is a cheap semantic move or something evasive, but it isn't - it's a conceptual argument about how the burden of Free Will should be understood.  Imagine someone came up to you and said, \"Hey - did you know that you can *never* make a good decision because you can *never* know what will happen with absolute certainty?\"  Most people would say, \"Well, no kidding I can't know what's going to happen, but that isn't a very good way to define a \"good decision.\"   That's a useless and unhelpful way to think about decision making, especially good decisions in comparison to bad decisions.\"  This isn't a trivial game of word golf here - this is a substantive dispute about how we should think about what it means to make a \"good decision.\"  Importantly, there isn't some rock somewhere that we turn over which has this definition printed on it.  \"Free Will\" is the same way.  We might first ask what the concept is supposed to do.  One thing it is often thought to do is be a necessary condition for moral responsibility.  That is, I can't be blamed for what I do if I had no control over what I'm doing.  Once we can agree on that much (that Free Will is the thing you'd need to be morally responsible), then it should become clear that it's not obvious that libertarian free will (the kind of free will which determinism would deny - the weird freedom from causality) is necessary for moral responsibility.  As a result, there have been lots of theories of moral responsibility which accept determinism going back, at least, to the ancient stoics (who developed a pretty famous ethical system and were causal determinists).  In sum - it's hard to know what you do or don't \"get,\" but it may just be that you have found yourself in that spot that a lot of first-time readers of compatibilism have found themselves in - thinking that the compatibilist is trying to pull a fast one or something.  That's not what's happening.  If anything, it's the Hard Determinists who are doing this, by trying to claim the necessary conditions for Free Will were decided already in a way which can't be contested.  This is nonsense.  Abstract and material terms are subject to contest and revision.  If they weren't, then the Hard Determinists couldn't avail themselves of a modern definition of causality.  ETA - My above analogy seems to have been helpful, but also a bit misleading.  So, to clarify a part of my analogy:  > Most people would say, \"Well, no kidding I can't know what's going to happen, but that isn't a very good way to define a \"good decision.\" That's a *useless* and unhelpful way to think about decision making, especially good decisions in comparison to bad decisions.\"  Some folks have seized on one clause in this hypothetical, but, really, I didn't mean it to be terribly important.  Really the argument here is about a *good* definition for Free Will.  (To be fair, I do also think that important concepts need some kind of utility.)  The argument between my two imagined persons is about the *better* way to think about a particular concept.  I avoid saying \"right\" or \"accurate\" here to avoid some other conceptual problems, though I think it's all the same thing.  Anyway, imagine an alternate situation instead from the point of view of the libertarian.  Say that the libertarian meets a person who declares, \"We have no free will!\"  The Libertarian says, \"Oh, yes!  I agree!  But, just in case, why do you think this?\"  The interlocutor says, \"Oh, well, having free will requires that I can do what I want.  I want to fly.  I cannot fly.  Therefore, I cannot do what I want to do.  Therefore, I don't have free will.\"  Whatever we can say about Libertarians, they don't believe *this*.  Clearly the Libertarian disagrees with this interlocutor.  Wherein lies the disagreement?  Probably the Libertarian will say this, \"No - I think you're a bit confused about what it might mean to 'do what you want' or else you're just confused about what having Free Will entails.\"  (Also, by the way, might not the Libertarian point out that this is a very silly way to think about Free Will given that everyone knows before the conversation starts that humans can't will themselves into flight?  This interlocutor has defined and ended the argument before it started.)  Anyway, here, the Libertarian would not be engaging in some semantic mumbo jumbo by trying to show this person that they've conceived of things wrongly.  If the Libertarian's response to this interlocutor is mumbo jumbo, then what does their own position even amount to?  Neither party of this dispute can turn over a rock to see who wins - they'll need to give some arguments for thinking that Free Will requires [x] or [y] - regardless of whether or not is *exists*.  As others have pointed out below, people have some kind of conception of Free Will and what matters about it, but this doesn't mean that all of those conceptions make sense or are equally good or, if you're willing, are *true*.  When we ask people what they think about Free Will, we learn *something*, but we don't obviously learn something about Free Will *itself*.  In the same way, we could ask people on the street what Time is and not learning anything about Time *itself*.  Here too, there is no easy rock to look under to find out what Time *is* (or else the A vs B debate would be long dead).  Or, if you don't buy this analogy, consider that folk definitions of Free Will almost always rely on a notion of Causation, and yet folk notions of Causation are often totally at odds with even what scientists think causation is like (much less philosophers).  Anyway, all I meant to do above is show one way to see how the argument between Hard Determinists and Compatibilists is something other than word golf or semantics.  And, to be really clear, philosophers who are divided about this are not confused here - folks in all the camps about Free Will give rather sustained arguments for their positions and understand this to be totally necessary to making their position justifiable - even the libertarians and hard determinists.  As a final amendment, some folks have suggested that what Compatibilists are doing is making a \"new\" definition for Free Will.  This also isn't true, since Compatibilist arguments go back *at least* to the Ancient Greek Stoics.  If that counts as \"new,\" well, then *everything* about modern hard determinism, unless, of course, Hard Determinists are using a theory of physical causation, the soul, and human motivation derived from Aristotle.

The below is meant to just highlight some areas that different objections can be pursued; it's not meant to be some standalone \"final word\" on the matter. I put this disclaimer at the beginning because I am not interested in \"debating\" responses to the below (as some people *really* want to when they read the below, though I'm happy to try and clarify things); I'm merely highlighting different avenues that have been pursued.  So: Much of this will certainly depend on exactly how utilitarianism is cashed out.  So, first, let's get a general statement of utilitarianism on the board. How about this: \"an act is right if and only if it maximizes happiness in the world.\" Now, we could get more precise, but we can use that as a working understanding. As you note, things might change if we move to preference-utilitarianism, or rule utilitarianism   Here are some of the issues that the utilitarian has to contend with:  1. Utilitarianism looks to make the notion of \"rights\" obsolete. For instance, tossing Christians to the lions in ancient Rome is bad for the Christian, but good for the Colosseum of Romans who are in ecstasy at the spectacle. If you have enough ecstatic Romans, then it looks like it's good, given utilitarianism, to toss the Christian to the lions.   2. Utilitarianism is too demanding. It seems to demand that that we always are to maximize happiness, in every action, at all times. And that's very, very, hard-- and hard in a way that seem to be too much of a cost for a moral theory.  3. Utilitarianism tries to put a single metric on value, and that's incoherent. Can we really compare the sort of value you assign to the life of your wife, with the value you assign to eating a Twinkie, with the value you assign to relieving yourself, with the value you assign to living the life of monk? For many people, it does not seem that all things that we value in life can be compared. e.g. I value twinkies. I also value my wife. How many twinkies is my wife worth to me? Utilitarianism asks questions like that all the time; for many people the question is ridiculous as a comparison is impossible. Some things differ in kind, not just in quantity. The point to be made is that the utilitarian assigns a single metric to all value, and that seem incoherent. The utilitarian says that the type of value got from scratching an itch is commensurable with the value of my wife. So, there will exist a relationship, such that some number times the value of itching a scratch equals the value of my wife. But, we might say, any equation looks wrong here. As Kant says, life has a dignity, and not just a price. The sorts of value involved here are incommensurable, if comparable.  4. Utilitarianism is under-specified, and when it is specified, those specifications are largely arbitrary. For instance, do we maximize aggregate happiness, or average happiness? Who is included? People, animals, future generations? How do we weigh \"high probability of little pleasure\" vs \"low probability of high pleasure\"? Here's another problem: assuming we can calculate the relevant utils, how do we deal with time? Do we look a second ahead, a year ahead or a century ahead? But why stop at a century? Why not 101 years, or 500 years or 865.324 years, or the second before all sentient beings are extinct? The normative prescription provided by utilitarianism can change from instant to instant. So what do you make of a theory that tells you that a certain action will produce a net +10 utils at time t, a net -5 utils at t+1, a net +100 utils at t+2, a net -1000 utils at t+3, etc, etc? If net utility can change from instant to instant (and it obviously can), then utilitarianism is of no service to moral agents in deciding how to act or how to value an action.  5. Utilitarianism seems to be a self-effacing theory in that there seem to be situations where making utilitarianism the publicly accepted moral system would actually produce less utility. So, utilitarianism might very well be a theory that works best if no one is thinking about it....very odd.  6. Related to 5. Utilitarianism tells us that an act is right if and only if it is optimific in regard to pleasure and pain. But you can't embody this reason in your motive for acting, and still have friends, loved-ones, etc. Under utilitarianism, you don't value your friends as *friends*, you value them as sources of pleasure; they are replaceable -- anything with the same effects on us will suffice. So, when you try to embody utilitarianism in your motives, you find that the person you supposedly love engages your thought not for him/her but as a source of pleasure. To embody in one's motives the values of utilitarianism is to treat people externally and to preclude love, affection, community. To get *these* goods while holding utilitarianism requires a schizophrenia between reason and motive. To the extent that you live utilitarianism, you will fail to achieve goods like friendship, love, inquiry -- and these are goods that the utilitarian himself recognizes as good. The objection is that you cannot embody your reason in your motives, as a utilitarian. The utilitarian says that friends, and love are goods. But you can't achieve these goods, while simultaneously embodying your reason in your motive.            Compare to the egoist: egoists take their own pleasure as the sole justification. From this, they should recognize the love, etc as among personal pleasures; so they have good reason on their own grounds to enter such relations. But when they act on their motive of pleasure-for-self they can't get those pleasures; to achieve these pleasures they have to abandon their egoistical motive; the egoist can't get the pleasures of love and friendship. For it is essential to the very concept of love that one care for the beloved, and be prepared to act for the sake of the beloved as a final goal. But to the extent that my consideration for you comes from my desire to lead a life that is personally pleasing, I do not act for your sake. So their motive and reasons pull apart. So, to get these goods they have to lead a sort of schizophrenic life.       Here's sort of how Susan Wolf understands the point: the utilitarian values these things only because of and insofar as they are a part of the general happiness. He values them under the description, \u201ca contribution to the general happiness.\u201d In contrast, real people might love, say, literature, because of the insights into human nature, or, growing roses because they are beautiful. Sure this may contribute to happiness, but this isn't the point to the non-utilitarian. For if one values these activities in more direct ways, one may not be willing to exchange them for others that produce an equal, or even greater amount of happiness. From that point of view, it is not because they produce happiness that these activities are valuable; it is because these activities are valuable in more direct and specific ways that they produce happiness. So, the utilitarian can't value things in the right way.   So, those are some basic problems. I should note, though, that utilitarians are smart people, and can give responses-- indeed, utilitarians have given responses, but the above is just supposed to be the basic sorts of issues that lead to needed refinement/argument. One of the big responses you'll see is that \"utilitarianism is not a decision procedure!\" By this, the utilitarian means that you should take the theory as reporting when actions are \"good\" and when they are \"bad.\" So, on this reading, we shouldn't use the theory of utilitarianism to decide how to act on particular occasions. (Indeed, many utilitarians grant that, in deciding how to act, it is counterproductive to consult the theory of utilitarianism). Moreover, just because it's difficult to determine what action maximizes happiness isn't a mark against the theory -- it just shows we are limited in our knowledge. Moreover, utilitarians will be utilitarian about how they assign praise and blame. So, for instance, say I jump in the water and, unbeknownst to me, save Hitler Jr., who goes to murder a bunch of people. Well, utilitarians might still praise my act as the right one (since, they want to promote saving drowning folk), even though my action was actually \"bad\" (since it led to a decrease in utility). Another way to see the same point: just because I do a bad action, doesn't mean I should be blamed for it, since whether or not I'm to be blamed is something we have to think about along utilitarian lines.  Some of the more spelled out versions of utilitarianism are interesting and deep. But, the sort of utilitarianism you sometimes see in economics, law, public policy, may be \"too quick.\"  It may have a certain air of \"spurious rigour,\" where we mistake quantification and calculation for cogency of thought. It might be a great moral theory for omniscient beings (though even this is in question). But for those of us who lack that quality, utilitarianism may be seen as just a device to cloak moral bias with the guise of mathematical certainty.

Honestly, you don\u2019t even have to start by reading philosophy, you can go on YouTube and watch lectures there instead, to get introductions to specific philosophers and their core concepts. I very strongly recommend you watch Michael Sugure\u2019s channel on YouTube, he was a historian of ideas teaching in Princeton in the 70s and 80s I believe, and he uploaded all of his lectures regarding introductions to core philosophers on his channel. They\u2019re all amazing, and brilliant place to get into different thinkers. Also, another important point: wether we like it or not, we live in time, and everything has a history, including philosophy; so, as much as you can, read philosophy in historical order, and also very importantly, try to understand the historical era in which philosophers were writing in: for instance, you cannot and shouldn\u2019t try to read philosophers from the 17-19th century without understanding more broadly what was going on in Western Europe during that time, namely, the Enlightnemt. Same applies to all the eras- to separate a philosopher from the era in which they were writing would be a big mistake in your path in understanding what exactly they meant: you might, for instance, find some philosophers to be bigots if you don\u2019t take into consideration how revolutionary their ideas were relative to the social context in which they were writing in, because, at the end of the day, a great many of them also had ethical motivations in mind when writing their philosophy, and therefore their writings were meant for the people of their age, not for us, x many centuries later.  As for where to start precisely with reading actual philosophy, I\u2019m sure others have told you this already, but I believe Plato\u2019s Republic is by far the best place to get into philosophy; pay particular attention to the allegory of the cave, and try to understand it as deeply as you can (use your intuition, not just your reason to do so); try to put it into your context as hard as you can. I guarantee that when you understand it properly, your outlook on all of philosophy and its purpose from that point onwards will change forever.  Other than that, I\u2019d tell you to prepare yourself mentally before going into non-rational 20th century enlightenment and American philosophy, because philosophy before the 20th century in America and England was, for lack of a better expression, trippin balls compared to what people in the anglophone world believe nowadays. So yeah, prepare yourself mentally, find people to talk about your thoughts if you can, and be sure to have a stable emotional support system around you, especially once you get to Spinoza, Nietzsche, Bergson, the existentialists, the post structuralists, etc., because, although they have the most amazing and beautiful ideas, they\u2019re also the most kind shattering ones too, so be prepared for when your structure of the world will change.

I was watching the 2018 conversation between Jordan Peterson and Matt Dillahunty.  The conversation got to a point where Dillahunty was describing his (and Sam Harris') rational morality system.  From my understanding, in this system they contend that societal/personal \"wellbeing\" can be reduced to a set of axioms, and rational analysis can be applied to these axioms to maximize \"wellbeing\".  This seems quite logical to me.  However, a conflict occurred when Dillahunty implied that the axioms themselves can be derived through rational analysis.  Peterson pushed back on this notion, infamously asking \"how do you know chopping off your head is bad for your wellbeing?\" Dillahunty replied saying if we are acting from the assumption of maximizing some aspect of life, then avoiding death is inherent in the maximization problem.  This again seems perfectly logical to me.  But I believe Peterson's skepticism can be applied again: why should we attempt to maximize wellbeing?  More generally, I see the problem as this: a logical system (rationality) can be used to maximize some function (wellbeing) given a set of initial axioms (wellbeing is good).  I have no concerns with this logical formulation.  However, a skeptic can always question the axioms.  The usual reply from a rationalist is that \"most can agree that wellbeing is good\", but this is an argument ad populum, which may be sufficient from a practical standpoint, but cannot be used as definitive proof of the initial axiom.    So my question: a rationalist claims to only hold beliefs when evidence supports the claim.

The irrational animals all possess only their will - what differentiates man, what Aristotle called the rational animal, from the rest is that man has the faculty of reason in addition to will, which allows us to deliberate on our acts; this is what gives us our freedom to choose between goods.  Irrational animals, however, do not have reason; instead, they have only the appetites - the will. So they all will things based on their appetites (i.e. they act according to instinct and in response to stimuli, but they cannot deliberate on their acts and choose accordingly like man can). They may appear to deliberate, such as if an ape is given a puzzle of some kind, but they are unable to actually reason about it; at best, they may follow an instinctual algorithm, such as a computer might do, such as trial and error problem solving. They could not, however, consider universals and reason about them; they could not, for example, reason about triangles and deduce that the degrees of their three inner angles must always add up to the same number.  This idea has also been picked up by modern philosophers in Animal Cognition (SEP article for reference), such as Donald Davidson, who (to roughly summarize) argued that the ability to reason is tied to language and belief - since reason is consideration of things in the mind, it must include an understanding of things different from mere observation of reality, and so there must be the ability to be surprised: to quote:  > Surprise shows that one can discriminate between the purely subjective and the objective. In order to have the capacity to be surprised, and therefore to have beliefs, one needs the\u00a0concept\u00a0of belief, to be able to understand that there is an objective reality that is independent from our beliefs.

And then this sets up a larger argument extending through the transcendental analytic, according to which geometry is then a pure science of the relations holding between spatial things, so that we can know apodictically that physical things must be adequate to geometrical description, and this thereby furnishes us with an epistemology justifying one of the methodological peculiarities of modern physics.  The way these issues develop in the critical response developed from Helmholtz through Mach to logical positivism is that philosophers will increasingly distinguish different senses of space: intuitive space, as the space of our imagination and visual perception; formal space, as the space constructable in geometry; and physical space, as the space of physical relations.  The challenge is that these senses seem to be collapsed, or at least intrinsically connected, on Kant's view. As, on Kant's view, it seems that intuitive space provides the conditions for formal space and these two jointly provide the conditions for physical space, such that if intuitive space is Euclidean, then so must formal and physical space be.  Whereas, on the critical reception, these three senses of space become more independent. I.e., on this later view, it could be that intuitive space is Euclidean, but that doesn't mean formal space has to be, and indeed it seems that mathematicians can construct a variety of formal spaces, including both Euclidean and non-Euclidean. And since this freedom of mathematicians permits us to think of these different spaces, there is likewise a freedom in physics to choose which of them is adequate to the demands of physical theory, as happens in the choice of non-Euclidean geometry for space as constructed in general relativity.  Underpinning this move is the rejection of Kant's dual-source model of knowledge which categorically distinguished between intuition and understanding as joint bases of cognition, and which manifests in the distinction in Kant's epistemology between the transcendental aesthetic and transcendental analytic. On Kant's view, this mooring of understanding to intuition, as joint factors, restricts the capacity of the understanding to posit mathematical structures to those which can be exhibited in intuition. Conversely, on the later view when the understanding has been unmoored from a supposedly distinct doctrine of intuition, it is free to construct whatever mathematical structures can be grounded on merely the principles of conceptual construction as such.  And then the experimental challenge would be: if it turns out that scientific findings demand this later approach, then this would provide us with a prima facie reason to prefer it over Kant's.", "human_ref_B": "You might find this overview interesting: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/genrel-early/", "labels": 1, "seconds_difference": 31578.0, "score_ratio": 6.6666666667}

On a different note, it's not even obvious to me that Plato advanced the dilemma as an attack on a conception of ethics.

All Plato means is that if the gods love it because it's pious, then we want to know what piety is, and Euthyphro hasn't given us the definition. In other words, by taking that option, Euthyphro wouldn't be undermining divinity, or anything like that; he just wouldn't be answering the question. Socrates wants Euthyphro to give an account of piety. Euthyphro would have to give us the definition used by the gods! The readings of the *Euthyphro* that followed Plato's death didn't really square with Plato's system anyways, since Plato 1) believed that some god existed and 2) believed that piety exists external to this god.

My first course on phenomenology was absolutely humbling. Either way:  Husserl's goal is to solve what he believed to be the greatest epistemological crisis of science in general. He noticed how the sciences had been limited to the physical world by Galileo and Descartes so they could study mechanics, but, due to its great success, this method kept being used.   However, scientists very quickly forgot that they were not studying \"the world\" but only a self-limited version of it (the physical world, where anything that's not quantifiable by the methods of physics gets left out as not existing). Until here, all good, right? Sort of. The problem is that science is an empirical science, which is based on perception, which is something we have access to through our subjective view of the world, i.e., the objective world of sciences is grounded upon the subjective world of perception.   But sciences work, and give good results, right? Yes, they do. But, for Husserl, the matter is that science, as section of our culture, has as its goal to uncover the truth, not merely subjective or \"practical\" truths. Therefore, a new way of doing science is needed, so that science can have a strong, unwavering foundation.  Husserl saw a talk by Brentano (a naturalistic psychologist of the late 19th century) where he exposed what Husserl believed to be one of the greatest discoveries of psychology ever: the intentionality. This is the base structure of conscious acts, i.e., everything that we do with our minds has this structure: the act itself (believing, doubting, seeing, hearing, wanting, etc.), the content (a door, a dog, happiness, a theory, a smell, etc.), and a degree of existence (i.e., when we hear our friends tell us about their childhood, it has a different status as when we read about Harry Potter's childhood. Not because the latter is a \"lie,\" but because it is fictional).  Husserl arrived at this point by using one of his methods: the eidetic or phenomenological reduction and the epoch\u00e9. This reduction method, i.e., allows you to figure out the \"essence\" of things by changing things about this thing as much as  you want without it not being that thing anymore and the epoch\u00e9 is a suspension of knowledge we have acquired from the natural world (i.e., not using things learned about the natural world to explain the subjective experience that precedes it, otherwise we would remain in an epistemological problem). You can do this with doors, changing color, size, form, etc. to understand the point. But Husserl's goal was not metaphysics, he was studying the subjectivity, so, what he did was use this method on mental structures to figure them out (like in the case of the intentionality that's present in all intentional acts). (There's also the transcendental reduction, but that one is probably not as relevant for you right now.)  He did this to many other mental structures, construction of time (past, present, future), empathy/intropathy (perceiving the other as a subjectivity like ourselves), construction of spatial objects, etc.  Important to note: 1) phenomenology is *descriptive* endeavor: it does not explain things regarding subjectivity, it merely describes them as they are; 2)  phenomenology is entirely restricted to the domain of subjectivity, it does not make claims about the natural world. It is entirely restricted to the study of subjectivity. It does not do metaphysics.   I hope I was of help.

By doing this, he's able to get on route at the time scheduled so he doesn't face any repercussions for his tardiness (Whether this relates to how pilots really work is something I have no clue of. This example, as it was explained to me, is just about the principle). Now, say we discover that there was absolutely nothing wrong with the plane. All the equipment is stacked appropriately, the oxygen masks come down correctly, ect. Did the pilot do something wrong? I think so. The potential negative consequences were high enough and the benefit low enough that it seems to me that he has made a morally objectionable risk. It could turn out that bees are simply incapable of suffering, in which case our current practices (absent ecological concerns) are acceptable, but it's at least plausible that they do.

If we were to sum stoicism up crudely, we might consider it an attempt to alleviate suffering through cognitive evaluation of what we experience. Epictetus, for example, asks us to consider our experiences and classify them as things we either can or cannot control. We should worry about what we can do something about, but it makes no sense to concern ourselves with what we can't control. Some of his examples are pretty out there, let's take being on a ship stricken by a violent storm. Epictetus chastises his students for \"talking the talk\" but not putting what they have learned into practice. They might wail and cry at the storm and the threat of a terrible death by drowning. However, in order to truly be philosophers, they ought to be able to suppress their fear of death by recognising the whole situation as being beyond their control and nothing worth worrying about. It is the same with the sickness of a child, being sentenced to death, suffering grievous bodily harm, etc.  In Buddhist practice the approach is somewhat different. Classification of experiences can play a role, but attaining non-attachment through the intellect is no Buddhist objective. Buddhist practice encourages us to let our thoughts and feelings pass and subside *without* judgement (which is a kind of attachment). Trying to suppress our thinking/feeling with thinking is like trying to pull our way out of a Chinese finger trap. The difference is that stoics assume that feelings result from judgements and that by getting the judgements right, you'll get the feelings right too. Buddhist practice, on the other hand, reveals that feelings emerge in the absence of judgements and are not reliant on them. Feelings are even the soil out of which thoughts grow. Buddhism also lays greater emphasis on the body. To assume and sustain the right posture *is* to assume and sustain the right attitude. For Epictetus, however, our body is an external and something out of our control - the only thing which is truly \"ours\" is our power to evaluate things.  Epictetus, as is well known, lived a life of privation and was a slave for many years. A man with little or nothing to his name. I wonder, though, when Epictetus retired into obscurity and adopted a child if he found it as easy to \"walk the walk\" as he did when he was a bachelor running a philosophy school?

I will, therefore, consider this opinion, asking first why it obtains general credence, and why all men are naturally so prone to adopt it ? secondly, I will point out its falsity; and, lastly, I will show how it has given rise to prejudices about good and bad, right and wrong, praise and blame, order and confusion, beauty and ugliness, and the like.  God, in Spinoza, is not an invisible man living in the sky.  God is Nature:  \"For the eternal and infinite Being, which we call God or Nature, acts by the same necessity as that whereby it exists.\"  Once you understand that bit, you should go back and re-read Book 1.

I would say, in the first place, let's take it for what it is - it's not a podcast about Fanon, right.  Sugrue is more or less shooting the breeze with his daughter in relation to a chapter she just read - I don't say \"about\" because they don't say anything about the subject of that chapter, the relationship between the colonized subject and language.  What Sugrue does say is puzzling and on a range between accidentally deceptive to the audience (when he talks about emotion and violence) to just wrong (when he talks about the reversal of colonialism ending with nothing other than amoral black supremacy).  Moreover, parts of his analysis are weirdly self-contradictory, as when he seems to criticize Fanon's psychologism, and then basically gives a (incredibly superficial) psychologistic reading of Fanon as being, basically, a very mad dying guy who is angry about \"every slight\" ever visited on him.  Yet, later, it seems like he more or less cops to the idea that colonialism was horrible and genocide is horrible and that atonement is necessary, but, like, the idea that this atonement might itself be violent is, I guess, so unimaginable that Fanon is just a guy \"with matches.\"  As you estimate, this just can't be a very good reading of Fanon, and I don't think it really intends to be.  I think we could and should reasonably criticize him for putting this nonsense out into the ether, but it's plainly non-serious discourse where he's just kind of dishing dissess and platitudes with his daughter as the two of them share cross-generational catholic angst about the downfall of western civilization thanks to the bankruptcy of academia - he a late/end career Great Books professor and she an undergraduate struggling through the detritus of the 20th century post-blah-blah humanities.  So, anyway, I think the question here ought to be reigned in with respect to what happens.  Is Sugrue reliable?  Well, about what and in what setting?  I'm not really sure what we could take him to be reliable *about* here because he doesn't really talk about anything specific in much level of detail and, when it does, it's a kind of weird mess (as you suggest).  Now, compare this to what his old *Great Courses* lectures are like.  They're prepared, for one thing, and they're specific and exegetical, for another thing.     So, centering this on the person is, I think, likely to be confounding because a person can do a lot of things in a lot of contexts.  If you want an entertaining (if partial, because of how he see's Plato historically) detailed exegesis of Plato, then his old lectures are great.  And, to his credit, he's actually a pretty serviceable interpreter of Nietzsche and (at least back when he did his old *Great Courses* lectures) gives a pretty sensitive reading of Nietzsche.  (He calls him both one of the greatest thinkers in the whole western tradition, and also calls him a racist, mysoginist, and anti-semite.)

He said:   \" Wittgenstein actually had glaring gaps in his understanding of mathematical logic.  E.g., in the Tractatus, he argues against Russell's Paradox on the basis that a function \"can't be its own argument,\" which one reviewer described as \"appearing philistine and arrogant\" (in light of the untyped Lambda Calculus), and which seems to have been based on a misunderstanding of the origin of the paradox  that it stemmed from Basic Law V of Frege's Begriffsschrift admitting the course/range of values of a function (i.e., sets of ordered pairs) and extensions of \"concepts\" (predicates) as objects in the domain of discourse.  But one can actually prove easily that \u2203x\u2200y(y \u2208 x <-> \\~(y \u2208 y))  leads to a contradiction in \\*First-Order Logic\\* (meaning \\~\u2203x\u2200y(y \u2208 x <-> \\~(y \u2208 y)) is a theorem of FOL).   So the actual culprit is naive, unrestricted set comprehension, not the second-order nature of Frege's system.    His writings also display a shocking lack of understanding of Godel's Incompleteness theorems.  He also made no formal contributions to mathematical logic (in terms of proving novel metatheorems).   There's no \"Wittgenstein's theorem,\" for example.   Compare him with a powerhouse like Tarski, who derived numerous fundamental results in mathematical logic (e.g., the upward and downward arbitrary cardinal versions of the Loweheim-Skolem Theorem), and also made contributions to the philosophy of logic (e.g., on the nature of the logical consequence relation, and the argument for the primacy of the semantic version over the syntactic version). \"  Can anybody here confirm this?

They are contradictory, but rather than the contradiction seeking immediate resolution, it is an engine of change for both of the model's components.

The fact that I can type \"I experience consciousness\" is proof that my consciousness can affect the physical universe. It's also obviously affected by the physical universe. Is it then not just a part of the physical universe? And if it's part of the physical universe, how could it be inherently unmeasurable?  I heard an argument in a TED talk that compared consciousness to life. It was thought centuries ago that life was an immeasurable force that we would never understand. And nowadays, we understand the chemical processes of life pretty well thanks to things like microscopes etc.  This argument at first didn't appeal to me, for two reasons. One was that the chemical process of life is very different than our experience of consciousness. And another one was that I didn't think it would necessarily be reasonable for a person in history to assume life is a set of chemical reactions given lack of evidence, and therefore it may be unreasonable for a modern person to assume something similar about consciousness.  But then I began to think on it further, and I no longer think such a theory of life would have been so unreasonable. I think an especially wise person back in history could have postulated that things life water flowing, freezing, melting is some kind of \"small scale life,\" followed by a process like fire being slightly \"more alive,\" followed by molds, then plants, then animals. Of course water isn't alive, but all of these are chemical processes with increasing complexity. And similarly, I think looking at machines of the day like mills would have been able to give a wise person the idea that life is machinery -- this is actually pretty apparent with things like the watchmaker argument.  Another example that comes to mind is color. I could imagine that there were once people who may have argued that color is not measurable -- like how red something is. Maybe this is a strawman, and that nobody ever argued this. But I certainly do find it fantastic that color is now very very measurable due to our understanding of the wavelengths of light. I feel like a reasonable person otherwise could be convinced that color is inherently subjective in the way we nowadays argue that pain and happiness is inherently subjective.  I think the argument for life applies to consciousness. I am most familiar with my own, but I have good reason to believe everyone else is too. And to a lesser degree, I can be pretty confident that my dog is conscious. Down to bugs perhaps less so. Plants could be, they do move to follow the sun. Bacteria could be barely conscious too. Looking at it from this lens, it seems sort of absurd to say consciousness has an arbitrary cutoff point where it suddenly arises in fish or whatever.  Is it not reasonable to imagine that we merely lack the instruments to measure it? That perhaps one day, I'll be able to experience another beings consciousness directly thanks to technology? And perhaps be able to answer fundamental questions like \"do we see red the same way or just call it by the same name?\" Is the lack of a current technology that can do this a good argument that we won't be able to in the future?

Here are two criticisms.   First, Rawls fiats that parties behind the veil of ignorance know the \"basic truths\" of human psychology, sociology, political science, economics, and so on. Critics point out that there are hardly established truths in these fields, and so Rawls is caught in a dilemma: either enumerate exactly what these truths are (and thus open himself to criticism on this front) or don't, rendering his theory too formal to be of use. The idea here is that Rawls has really punted the difficult questions of social organization down the line while giving the impression that he's come to substantive conclusions. For example, he himself thinks his theory supports both socialist and capitalist modes of organization. If a theory of political organization doesn't decide between something so fundamental to the structure of a society, then what good can it be? (says the critic).  Second, Rawls thinks that there's going to be *deliberation* behind the veil of ignorance which leads to conclusions about the structure of society. But, given that parties behind the original position are formally identical (e.g. minimally rational, with no contingent features influencing their decisionmaking, etc.), it's hard to imagine what this deliberation would look like.

Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not go harassing some of the scholars I talk about, despite their terrible takes. These are issues to be dealt with in journal articles and NOT random internet strangers harassing people. As far as I am concerned the matters discussed have been addressed.\r   \r   **Second, I want to provide some context on my academic background:**  \r   I have a master's degree in music composition, and strong subject-matter experience in Musicology. My main area of interest is in American composer Lou Harrison, parts of whose life and works I am considered an expert on. I also have dabbled in discussing the relationship between late 19th/early 20th century French music and Orientalism, which happens to have a fair amount of crossover with Harrison criticism.  \r   Philosophically, I am interested in action, ethics, pedagogy, and emotions. I am a huge Martha Nussbaum fan. out of every scholar/author I have read she has probably had the largest impact on my writing and approach to academics.\r   \r   Anyways, on to the story of how I fell into a research topic, and how the crazy stuff I found changed my thesis.\r   \r   The topic I am currently involved in is discussing the ethics of cultural appropriation in the context of music scholarship. Most recently I wrote and presented at a conference, a very brief version of a 75 page paper on the subject matter (this was in 2021).\r   In Lou Harrison scholarship there are two extreme camps (I'm exaggerating their positions here for the sake of clarity, I don't have time for lit review), with some people being a little more subtle than others:  \r   1) Lou Harrison could do nothing wrong, his music is not cultural appropriation. How do you even suggest this?  \r   2) Lou Harrison is a hardcore Orientalist and a Musical Colonist.  \r   To make matters worse, most of the scholars on the subject had some sort of personal relationship with Harrison, or are white gamelan musicians/composers with serious stakes as they pertain to the question: \"Was Lou Harrison an appropriator?\" It is really REALLY difficult to find any scholarship on the topic that is not serving some sort of personal agenda.\r   Generally speaking, the people in camp #2 don't really address any of the concerns of the people in camp #1, since the folks in camp #1 knew Harrison to be a very nice guy with strong moral convictions. Camp #1 believes camp #2 is very unfair to Harrison. Camp #2 tends to found its critiques of Harrison on post-colonial scholarship, which camp #1 believes denies the historical fact that Harrison was a good person with good intentions who studied gamelan directly.\r   \r   The people in camp #1 tend to have been friends with Harrison in life, or have personal stakes in writing for Javanese Gamelan ensemble, so are obviously going to take issue with camp #2. Camp #1 also has some pretty bad arguments as to explain what Harrison did was not appropriation/isn't problematic in some way.\r   \r   The first line that really drove me batty is from a popular and recent (and actually quite good) Harrison biography:  >\r   \"to paint Harrison as a cultural colonialist and \u201cappropriator\u201d of artistic resources is a naive moral judgement...As a gay man, \\[sic\\] sympathized with victims of bigotry, including those subjected to colonialism\"  \r   \rThis line bothered me when I first encountered it, but I was still trying to explain away Harrison's cultural appropriation. Tackling the problem from an ethics perspective hadn't quite occurred to me yet. It goes without saying that the argument is a weak ethical argument, and a frustrating blemish on a really good book.\r   \r   It was not until I encountered an article entitled \u201cIssues of Pastiche and Illusions of Authenticity in Gamelan-Inspired Composition\u201d by an English(?) gamelan scholar that I ended up with my paper topic. \r   \r   **Short Summary of the article**\r   \r   The author of this article is interested in what may constitute \u201cauthentic\u201d Javanese music, and an authentic expression of \u201cbi-musicality.\u201d Bi-musicality means a way of operating in and between two distinct musical traditions as to create a hybrid sort of music. I\u2019ll get back to what reasons Sorrell had for arguing this when I talk about why I LOATHE this article in a bit.\r   \r   Sorrell argues for the existence of a sort of \u201cbi-musicality\u201d and critiques Harrison\u2019s music as  appropriative, with his main issue being \u201ccultural projection.\u201d Harrison\u2019s use of just-intonation in his writing for gamelan ensemble is an example of projecting the composer\u2019s western ideology onto gamelan, which is compounded by, \u201cHarrison\u2019s appropriation of Javanese terminology, as it carries specific expectations and suggests a more genuinely Javanese product than in fact exists.\u201d (Sorrell, 41) \r   \r   Up to this point, Sorrell\u2019s article isn\u2019t problematic. I think he actually had some very good points, but then he goes on and admits to lying about his name and race in a public concert to prove a point about perceived authenticity and why his own music is bi-musical (and therefore not appropriative).\r   \r  >\u201cIn order to deflect unwelcome focus on myself as the composer \\[of Missa Gongso\\], but even more to convey an illusion of authenticity to enhance the reception of the work, I adopted a pseudonym. In fact I invented a totally fictitious 20th-century Italian-Javanese composer (even more bi-musical than I could hope to be) by the fanciful name of Napoleon Sutono (abbreviated to \u2018Napotono\u2019), whose musical loves were gamelan, European polyphony and, above all, J.S. Bach.\u201d (Sorrell, 44)\r   \r  This passage made me so angry, and it was upon reading I knew I absolutely needed to crush this man (academically, of course. From what I hear he is actually quite nice). It was also in this passage where I realized that the main avenue of inquiry I should be exploring was NOT whether or not the music was appropriative, but rather the ethics of writing appropriative music. What makes appropriation unethical?\r   \r   The strategy of many of the articles I had read was to make ontological claims about what was/wasn\u2019t appropriation, and then to show that something was/wasn\u2019t ethical based on whether or not it was appropriation (Sorrell the biggest offender). \r   \r   This methodology is flawed, so I went diving for writings on the ethics of knowledge and appropriation and wound up finding Miranda Fricker\u2019s *Epistemic Injustice*.\r   \r   Eventually I revised my thesis. I moved away from defending Harrison on ethical grounds, and instead argued that his defenders need to be more reflective of the epistemic harms of their practices. My issue was not with musical content, but with the social context in which appropriative works are performed.", "human_ref_B": "Anyone else loving how active weekly discussion has been as of late?", "labels": 1, "seconds_difference": 259502.0, "score_ratio": 1.1666666667}

I can't precisely speak to their views of eschatology, but as some of the founders of Neoplatanism, I'm sure there's something there. Though, it's probably worth mentioning, at least for Pseudo-Dionysius this unity is quite paradoxical and involves basically a complete negation of the names of God.  &#x200B;  Augustine is perhaps the most notable Christian Neoplatanist, and I think one can read *The Confessions* precisely as transcending multiplicity toward the unity of the Trinity, emerging out of the lesser trinities. Augustine takes up Plotinus as perhaps his first influence, and references to the *Enneads* appear everywhere in his texts (if you look up the Chadwick translation, he is very good at drawing out the Neoplatonic influences).

Anglicanism has a rich history of Neoplatonism from the Cambridge Platonists in the 17th century and again by the Oxford movement in the 19th, though of course this influence is falling away as Anglicanism increasingly embraces a more post-modern relation to scripture. The Neoplatannist tradition is certainly still alive in 'high Anglicanism' and often also in the so-called 'low Anglicanism' in smaller country parishes at least insofar as they still hold onto the BCP, which is fundamentally a Neoplatanist prayer book.

We can then combine extra effects and try to derive an equation to explain what's being seen in the experiments.  Other times it works slightly differently. Maybe you want to know what parameters are actually useful to look at in an experiment. For example, I work in quantum transport, and one of my jobs is to look at an electron, look at all of the ways that electron in a certain system can interact with that system, and then figure out a model that the experimentalists can use to figure out what the best parameters are for their design.

You derive an equation, based on what we know, (this is where a lot of the traditional image of physicist at chalk board probably comes in, although we do that for all areas of physics) , you make some approximations (physicists love approximations), so that you can have a version of your equation that you can look at and go \"OK, if I make that number bigger, that number gets smaller, that means that this, this and this happens,\" so it's a quick way to see physical behaviour. Then, you can code up your full version and check to see how closely your approximations match, to make sure they're actually useful/find out where they stop working etc.  I hope that answer wasn't too long winded and was actually helpful!

All information that can be modelled by humans can be represented by binary.  In physics tho information relates to the thermodynamic entropy. And it is closely related to information entropy, intact they have very similar formulas.  In physics very basically more entropy means more \"disorder\" (not accurate) and to describe more \"disorder\" you need more information.  Like if all the air is in one tiny spot in a box or if its a solid, you can easily represent all the air molecules, as there will not be a huge number of ways that those molecules might be arranged in space but if it is spread out then the number of arrangement of those molecules, of where they potentially could be needs much more information to be fully defined.  Information entropy also relates to probability, in the sense that every bit of information, reduces your uncertainty by half.  You can also model information in terms of energy. Basically, energy is needed to erase information.  For eg, you drop a ball from height h, the ball will drop a couple times and will come to a stop. This is due to the ball losing its energy to friction and other losses. Once the ball have dropped can you tell from which height the ball was dropped? Nope, because that information have been destroyed, and it was destroyed by the ball using up its potential energy.  Information is central to a lot of things not just in physics.", "human_ref_B": "One of the rules of quantum mechanics is that processes are unitary.  What this means is that if you take a state that has a certain amount of uncertainty - a certain \"distance\" from a particular state where every possibility is equally likely - then the movement of that process through time will never take it closer to or further away from that uncertain state, it will always be no more or less similar to the \"I don't really know\" state than it was before.  So for example, if you measure the magnetic moment of an electron, so that you find which way its little bar magnet is pointing, and then let it move, it will slowly evolve through a set of states, each of which is associated with a particular direction, basically moving around like a top, even though you can't see it, the axis will be just as \"certain\".  This kind of certainty is not the same as classical certainty, because even if the magnetic moment of the electron points sideways, you can still represent that as \"50% up, 50% down\", and by measuring it, force it to pick one, and drop it back into the original axis you started with again, so there will always be uncertainty.  Another way to say it is that quantum systems will still give you answers to questions, even if they are bad answers; if someone is going west and you ask them if they are going north or south, the quantum way to answer is to give a 50:50 chance of giving either option.  But if you keep track of how it *should* be moving, given what you know about it's law of motion, and keep checking whether it is at that point, step by step, you can end up getting a given axis almost 100% of the time, subject to some small amounts of environmental disturbance.  This kind of property, that there is some measurement out there that, if it moves in a synchronised way with a state, will produce reliable classical answers, is called \"purity\", and you can think of a pure state as being fully defined by its starting point and some law of motion, like a classical trajectory.  In contrast, a mixed state hides information, usually because there's some other set of degrees of freedom that are relevant that you don't keep track of.  This state, with lower purity, can be considered a little subjective, in that you can always start by defining a state you have in terms of a mixed state, if you aren't totally sure how well you prepared it in its starting point. In other words, instead of an arrow pointing out of the electron showing where north is, you have a kind of sphere around it on which you've painted a fuzzy probability distribution, giving where you mostly think the north is.  Then you can apply the same unitary transformation, which carries forwards that classical probability distribution, that \"blob\" of options, to other positions around the sphere.  You might discover that your state actually has higher purity than you thought, if you prepare it a lot of times, and find that it consistently gives you the same fixed value step by step, whereas a really mixed state might give you something other than 100% probability of appearing where you expect it to be.  But that basically is unitarity; once you have classical uncertainty, the laws of physics will carry that forwards, not making it better or worse, just moving it around, until you do more measurements to resolve it.  The point about black holes is that they seem to still hide information, while also giving you all the energy back.  You chuck something into a black hole, and you never know what happened to it after that point, but meanwhile, the black hole is getting warm, giving out a gentle buzz of particles from its event horizon.  So you're getting something back, but it doesn't seem to be what you put in.  Or to put it another way, when you set up a black hole in a certain state - if we could build a solar-system sized lab - we don't have a theoretical way to assume that we could just guess what it is going to say next and check step after step after step.  It doesn't seem to just have the quantum \"randomness\" of failing to ask the right questions, but has the pure randomness of there being *no* set of measurements you can do that will give you consistent answers 100% of the time, even if you set it up perfectly. It has actual randomness.  That's the thing people are trying to fix, understand how what goes into a black hole controls what it spits out, so that they can see how the history of the black hole is hidden in its event horizon, so that you can go \"yep, photon leaving from that longitude and latitude, next we'll have a muon leaving there...\" at least in principle, even if such an actual detector is impossible.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 2020.0, "score_ratio": 6.6666666667}

If it ran 25% of the time, it wouldn't matter whether that was 1 hour out of four hours or one minute out of 4 minutes.  But the actual vapor compression refrigeration cycle relies on maintaining a pressure difference between the condenser and the evaporator.  Each time it turns on, the compressor needs to first build up that pressure difference before much of work the compressor is doing goes into refrigeration.  Then when it turns off, the pressures equalize between the condenser and evaporator, losing the work that was done to build up that pressure difference.  So there's a certain amount of energy wasted for each cycle, and the slower cycling fridge with the higher thermal mass uses less energy over the course of a day.  Note that better refrigerators will have smart* controls that will avoid having it cycle too fast even if there's very little inside.  But in order to prevent the short cycling, they have to allow the temperature inside to swing up and down more than it would if they allowed the fast cycling, and more than it would if the fridge was full.  Having the temperature cycle up and down a lot is worse for keeping food fresh, so even in that case, having more thermal mass inside is beneficial even if its effect on energy savings is reduced.  *By smart I mean a really basic level of well-designed controls, not being connected to the internet or having a color touch panel on the front or anything like that.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 32259.0, "score_ratio": 1.25}

Basically, there are certain features that tend to be specifically diagnostic of species difference when we look at hominids. Things like brain size, face length, brow size, tooth differences, cheek bone size, etc. The reason we look at these things is because they tend to be variable between species, but fairly consistent within species. And, even in cases where one or more of these traits is variable (e.g., a baby born with microcephaly), all the concomitant traits probably won't change much. For example, the authors note that this fossil has a mix of features that are commonly seen in more human-like hominids, and those more common in \"primitive\" hominids:   Like humans: > \"large cranial capacity, short face, and small check bones\"   More \"primitive:\" > \"low vault, strong browridges, large molars, and alveolar prognathism\" via Ni et al: https://www.cell.com/the-innovation/fulltext/S2666-6758(21)00055-2, published yesterday.   Because this combination of traits isn't known in any other hominid, and because it doesn't seem to showcase signs of any known disease or deformity, it's unlikely (although never impossible) that this is just, like, some guy who looked real weird.    Still, the leap that this is a brand new species just from one skull is problematic. First of all, there are known species of hominid that have unknown skull structures. The article you linked to mentions Devisovans as an example of this. They are a close relative species of ours, and some people of east Asian descent have their DNA in their genomes! We only know they exist because we sequenced the DNA of some non-skull bones, so we have no idea what their heads would have looked like. That means it's possible that this is just a skull of a species we already knew about. Even if this is the case, that's still a really cool find!    I should also mention that even if this is a species we already knew about, it's almost certainly not *H. sapiens*, as the time and place it was found doesn't match up with human migration.

So a better question would be, how close would you have to get to the sun for an ideal black body to be at room temperature? Spoiler alert: close to where the earth is. The answer is found by balancing incoming solar radiation with the outgoing blackbody radiation of the object, a common problem in introductory thermo classes.

The beam divergence depends heavily on how wide a flashlight you have to start with, if you had something which is quite compact the divergence is worse than something with a large output.

Many other viruses can affect the brain, including other coronaviruses. See this page for a summary of viruses that can directly affect the brain.  Here's a quote from a 2018 review paper talking about coronaviruses in general, before the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered: \"As described so far, coronaviruses are respiratory viruses that exhibit neurotropic capacities that not only allows them to achieve latency and avoid the immune response of the host, but also have neurological implications that can complicate the disease associated to its infection.\"  In other words, even in 2018, it was known that coronaviruses can affect the brain. With that said, the common cold is usually caused by rhinoviruses, not coronaviruses. It's very rare for rhinovirus infections to directly involve the brain (source, source). Still, rhinovirus infection can indirectly affect the brain by inducing cytokine release that causes things like fever and sickness behavior. Sometimes fevers from the common cold can even lead to seizures, but this is relatively rare and usually only happens in young children (source, source). The common cold does not usually cause high fevers in adults (source), but again can still indirectly affect the brain by causing low mood, fatigue, brain fog, etc. (source).  Unlike the common cold, COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) can directly affect the brain in multiple ways (source, source, source). As one paper writes, \"There is enough evidence to conclude that neurological symptoms and complications are an important feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 prompts a range of neurological complications, from common and somewhat mild symptoms, such as transient anosmia and ageusia; to more severe complications, albeit rarer, such as stroke, encephalitis or encephalopathy.\"  **tldr:** COVID-19 affects the brain more than the common cold virus, but other viruses can still affect the brain.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 2792.0, "score_ratio": 4.3529411765}

The idea with orange vs mint is that there's still mint in your mouth, so you're simply tasting both at the same time, right? The same is true for your Italian sub. Oil based compounds stay in your mouth for longer than water based compounds, and oils carry a lot of flavor in food. So your mouth is likely still coated with some of those meat juices when you eat the bread.   It's also not impossible that some of those oils / flavors soaked into the bread in your last bite, so if you would make an Italian sub, then remove all the toppings except mayo and mustard, it would have more flavor than a plain mayo and mustard sandwich.  And that all sticks to the pure mechanics of taste buds/your mouth - perception (what happens when those signals hit your brain) is an additional layer. I can't speak to the specifics of taste (motor system is more my specialty) but as a general rule all of our sensory perceptions affect each other, both within and across modalities. I.e. stimuli you experience from any of your physical senses can impact how you perceive stimuli from any other physical senses, whether it happens at exactly the same time or if there's a little delay between them.

Hearing one note played repeatedly is not often considered great music by itself, but when it is accompanied by a complex variety of of other notes and rythms it can be an essential part of a great tune.  Also, taste is not instantaneous - there and then gone - some tastes linger in your mouth and changes the perception of things you eat after the first bite. That's why some food cultures use \"palate cleansers\" - little bites of food intended to \"reset\" your taste buds and make every bite of a meal taste as good as the first one.

A circular winged airplane (like this) works exceedingly well--fold one and throw it like a football if you don't believe me.  Yet, i have no explanation for why it works so well.  In principle, a circular wing should provide no net force in any direction, yet it clearly has a lift force.  My other theory was that air funneled through the center should have a higher velocity and provide a lift force, but the plane stays aloft even without a positive pitch (I would also expect this to create a great deal of drag).

There are 2 important things in the design of a paper plane: Pitch Stability and Zero Lift Moment.  Pitch Stability first. A paper plane is basically a flat plate and flat plate aerofoils suffer from pretty horrendous pitching moments. To remain stable, the plane needs to be sufficiently nose heavy that the pitching force acts behind the centre of mass. Purely because it's stable, a plane can fly smoothly. It might smoothly veer sideways, or smoothly dive, but whatever it does will be reasonably smooth.  The next important thing is the Zero Lift Moment. For most paper planes you have a little bit of elevator flap at the back. This provides an upwards pitching moment when the plane is flying flat. The result of this is than instead of being pitch stable about 0 degrees, it's pitch stable about a small positive angle of attack. A flat plate with a small positive angle of attack provides lift, and you've got a working plane.  For a standard paper plane: All you need is to be pitch stable, with a small offset.  Now for our circular plane. Pitch stability is easy, all the weight is at the nose. But where does it get the offset from? How does it know to fly slightly upwards rather than in a smooth dive.  This is why it needs to spin. Because the nose is heavy, it would naturally fall forwards. But as it's spinning like a gyroscope, this forward tipping torque gets transformed into a small left (or right) rotation. Now it's flying at a tiny angle sideways, there's a torque restoring it to straight. Because its spinning this again gets transformed into a rotation upwards. The overall result is that what you should have a slight negative offset, but because its a gryoscope this ends up as a slight positive offset.  So to summarise for the circular plane: It's pitch stable like all good paper planes, and relies on gyroscopic effects to get a small pitch offset.", "human_ref_B": "If the ring is thrown totally flat I can see how you would say the ring should produce no lift, but the same is true of a regular paper airplane.  My guess at the effect here is twofold:  1. The spinning ring let's the flow stay attached rather than separate, so you won't stall the paper airplane.  2. You're creating some representation of a 2D airfoil and you eliminate drag effects from having a wing with ends.  I graduated with a BS and MS in aero engineering, but my aerodynamics work was mostly limited to taking and then TAing a junior level course, and that was years ago.  I'm guessing here off the top of my head.  I'll think about it more and give a more thought out explanation later if no one else gets here first.  Edit: I'm liking BorgesTesla's theory above.

The Wikipedia entry at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact\\_hypothesis includes the technical links needed to explore this more deeply. As far as I know this is the only hypothesis that can account for the current state of affairs of Earth and the Moon in our solar system.  What's truly fascinating to speculate about is the possibility that we wouldn't be here if Theia hadn't paid that fateful visit back in the day. One study proposes that the volatiles needed to form life were produced by Theia's impact:  https://www.universetoday.com/141342/without-the-impact-that-formed-the-moon-we-might-not-have-life-on-earth/  And our remarkably large Moon (relative to Earth) formed by this impact stabilizes Earth on its polar axis. Otherwise Earth's axial wobble would be much greater.   And Theia's iron core merged with ours, giving us a stronger Van Allen belt, which prevents the surface of the Earth from being bombarded by anywhere near as much radiation as would be the case otherwise.   We don't know if the amped-up Van Allen Belt and the \"gift of the volatiles\" and the faster rotation and the Moon-induced larger tides contributed to making Earth more favorable to life beginning here, but it seems plausible. And if all that is true--if life couldn't have started without our remarkably mild planetary climate and other conditions--then we could be alone in our galaxy.

Then enough matter came together to form a small gravity well. All of the nearby surrounding matter was attracted to it. However some of the surrounding matter had just enough velocity to miss the gravity well and avoid becoming part of the proto star that eventually became our Sun. This matter started orbiting the sun because it had just enough kinetic energy to not fall in. Again there was almost no preferred direction or plane of orbit. However, in the pure chaos things started colliding. If the momenta of colliding objects was roughly equal, those objects would fall into the star. If one object in the collision had more momentum, than the resulting combined object would have momentum in that direction. Given another few million-billion years and this process does an effective job at making most objects orbit the star in a single plane in one direction. Now each proto planet is formed by objects crashing together. Relative to the center of mass of what will eventually become the planet these objects will be going all different ways.

In addition, FDA expects that an EUA request will include a phase 3 safety database of well over 3,000 vaccine recipients, representing a high proportion of participants enrolled in the phase 3 study, who have been followed for serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest for at least one month after completion of the full vaccination regimen.

This second wave killing off more of the population results in less viable hosts to carry the virus. The elderly, who are typically prime candidates for other flu strains, had picked up partial immunity to the 1918 strain of H1N1 from the 1898-1905 outbreaks of the H3N8 \u201cRussian flu\u201d subtype. With most of the adults either already infected/dead, being treated for the flu, or already immune from the first wave, it essentially caused what has been termed social distancing during the current SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) - hosts were unable to encounter fresh hosts for the virus and, without a host and being an obligate parasite, the virus begins to die off.  Mutation, not to a deadlier strain, but to a milder strain, is also another factor. This occurs genetically when the virus is not encountering as many hosts, thus having to mutate to cause milder symptoms so that hosts with the new milder strain will spread it more easily.

If you put a strong acid into another solvent, they might no longer fully ionize. It would all come down to the Gibbs free energy of the proton exchange. Which in the simplest form is based only on the absolute temperature, change in entropy, and change in enthalpy. That form of the equation is all I ever got to as a Biochemist (i'm more into sequence analysis rather than the underlying chemical stuff). That's not the most satisfying answer. Since the change in enthalpy and entropy are just numbers you look up in a table. So I've kind of moved the problem w/o completely answering it.", "human_ref_B": "Several factors must be considered, here are the main ones:  Electronegativity - this is most commonly understood and talked about.  The more electronegative the atom bonded to the proton is, the more easily that bond will break heterolytically (both electrons go with one partner, aka the leaving group).  It makes sense because it is easy to imagine something that is much more electronegative than hydrogen taking both of the electrons in the bond which allows hydrogen to dissassociate.  Fluorine, chlorine, oxygen check this box.  Stabilization of the anion - The conjugate base of an acid usually has a negative charge, and that negative charge represents an instability for that molecule.  The more the negative charge can be spread throughout the molecule via a system of conjugation, the more stable it will be and, conversely, the more tightly focused that negative charge is on, say, a single atom for example, the less stable it is.  For example, bisulfate is able to spread its negative charge between three different oxygen atoms, contributing to its stability.  Conversely, fluoride is a tiny atom with its negative charge tightly focused, which is a significant contributing factor in fluoride not fully dissociating as you would expect based on electronegativity alone.  There are also many extreme examples of anion stability in large conjugated systems in organic acids, especially in cases where the freeing up of the electron pair enables a much larger conjugated system by joining two smaller ones  (or, better yet, an aromatic system!).  The stability of conjugate bases is a part of a larger topic in chemistry about the stability of leaving groups, the same principle applies.  People frequently use pKa as a good measure of the stability of a conjugate base or leaving group.  Solvent stabilizing effects - When we are talking about acids, we are always talking about water as the solvent, but the chemical structure of the acid and the solutes in the water can vary, which can significantly impact the stabilizing or destabilizing effects of the solvent on the proton and anion of a dissociated acid.  For example, organic acids usually get a boost in their dissociation in water because of their inherent instability in water - dissociating in to a pair of ions frequently increases their stability in water.  Also, solutes in water can increase or decrease the ability for water to stabilize ions created in the dissociation of acids.  Edit:  The answer to your sulfuric acid, chloride question requires an additional consideration.  Oxygen is more electronegative than chloride, sure, but due to the valency of oxygen, it is always bonded with something other than the proton and since oxygen is more electronegative than everything other than fluorine, whatever else oxygen is bonded to is always donating (relatively speaking) electric charge to the oxygen, making oxygen less able to pull electrons away from the proton.  Having said that, though, sulfuric acid is still one of the stronger oxyacids due to its ability to spread out that negative charge.  So based on this you would expect oxyacids which are bonded to carbon rather than sulfur to be less acidid because carbon is less electronegative than sulfur.

What age group?  \u2014and of course these all overlap, so asking about protection against hospitalization in elderly people 8 months after vaccination in the UK might not tell you much about protection against infection in 30-year-olds in the US.  The ballpark answer is that alpha and delta have minor to moderate reductions in vaccine efficacy, and beta has a larger reduction, relative to the original strain. Putting together a bunch of studies, and simplifying wildly, if you\u2019re starting with an mRNA vaccine and you received it fairly recently you might have 95% protection against symptomatic disease from the original strain, maybe 80-90% protection against symptomatic disease from alpha and delta, and maybe 60-75% against beta. Scale all those numbers down some if you\u2019re further out from your vaccine, if you\u2019re asking about protection against asymptomatic infection, if you\u2019re elderly or immune compromised.   Another way to look at it is to ask how much difference in antibody concentration you need to neutralize the same numbers of each virus. If you need 1x amount of antibody to neutralize your little vial of original strain, you might need 5x that amount for alpha and delta, and 8-12x as much for beta. Antibody titers don\u2019t correlate linearly with protection, and a ballpark estimate might be that mRNA vaccines give you 10-50x as many antibodies as you need for protection, against original strain, on day 1.  So if antibodies wane by half over a year, you might still be protected against original strain, but mildly susceptible to delta.   Bottom line is that alpha and delta (as well as the D614G mutation that appeared early in 2020 and that everyone has already forgotten about) are mainly transmission-enhancing variants, with immune evasion as a mostly accidental side effect. The beta variant seemed to be more of an immune evasion variant without much transmission enhancement, and so it\u2019s not surprising it was outcompeted and seems to be fading away.

Estimates based on genetic data vary widely, but anthropological evidence suggests the first major migrations out of our species' African birthplace were between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago.  That's not even a very direct way to answer this, actually, but I'll try to explain the intuitive idea behind it. Who are you more related to, your grandfather or your first cousin? Well, think about all the \"hops\" your genome has been through. Half your grandfather's genome hopped into your mother (we'll assume it's your maternal grandfather), and then half of that hopped into you. Two hops. Your *kinship coefficient*, the degree of relatedness between you (technically the probability that you have both inherited the same genetic material from the same origin - in this case your grandfather himself would be the origin) is 1/4.  To get to your first cousin, you have to hop up twice to your grandparents, then hop down again twice to the cousin, so four hops. What's the kinship coefficient? Well, it's actually 1/8, not 1/16, because although there were four hops, there were two different paths (one through your grandfather and one through your grandmother, since you have them in common).  So basically, one way of asking how related you are to any random human in the population is to ask how many generations ago your most recent common ancestor was. This number will vary widely; if you're both German, it's probably much more recent than if one of you is Korean and the other is from a tribe of !Kung San in the Kalahari desert, in which case you might have to trace your common origins all the way back to the first African humans.  ---  That said, it should still be very possible to estimate the average genetic distance between any two living humans, given all the data we've accumulated now. It could be trickier to model the hypothetical gene pool of humanity from 10,000 years ago, and I don't remember enough coalescent theory to do it myself, but I hope some pop-gen expert comes along soon because a lot of the answers in this thread are just naive math that's obviously wrong.", "human_ref_B": "There are a few caveats about our genes that you have to consider before taking on this question fully. Humans have greater genetic variance in general than the races have genetic variance from one another. Racial differences are actually a very small portion of our overall genetics. For instance, skin color is a combination of a handful of genes, where a more complex process like digestion has genes numbering in the hundreds. However, of course races do have differing probabilities of having certain genes. Dairy consumption is a good example- among humans that are not northern European, lifelong lactase production to digest dairy is rare at about 2-5% of the population, but among northern Europeans it is highly common being more like 70-80% of the population. Although the entire human race circulates the genes for dairy digestion, that it is so common in northern Europeans is a racial difference. As you can see, the racial difference is not a gene that no one else has, it is merely commonality of a gene the other races have rarely. Every racial difference is this way.  Also, large population groups maintain most of their genes, recirculating them, reducing evolutionary movement. Humans have had populations large enough to breed out almost all mutation for a very long time (if I remember correctly, the last time humans were nearly extinct was because of a volcano 80,000 years ago or so- it was at that time that the races \"split,\" before then there was a more gradual change in traits as you changed location, instead of a few major obviously differentiated groups). Adaptations like the lighter skin and dairy digestion of northern Europeans, where calcium deficiency drove the change by killing off the group members with darker skin and inability to digest dairy, take up to 20,000 years. Although changes in gene commonality occur through selective pressure, mutations are rarely passed on more than a couple generations. As well, if there is no selective pressure creating a change in gene commonality, the population will maintain the same ratios its ancestors had. So, although decreased melamine and increased lactase production were selected for in northern Europeans, most other genes are practically identical in variance to African's. With a few genes, known to be racial differences, you can predict race by genetics extremely precisely, however if you choose random genes you can't tell just about anything.  But, it's important to remember that just because half of your genes come from each parent, doesn't mean that some of their genes didn't match in the first place. As an obvious proof, racial differences are practically always passed on, because both parents share those genes, and thus there is realistically zero chance of the child not inheriting those traits. Your parent's preexisting genetic similarity means that you are slightly more than a half copy of each to the degree that they were slightly already copies of each-other (due to common ancestry). By this mechanism, a village of several thousand people with little immigration or emigration (as most of humankind has existed for most of the last 10,000 years) will simply pass around the genes it already had, changing in relation to each other very little no matter how much time passes (so long as environmental factors remain ineffective- go farming!?).    Now to answer the question: the population of a little village like that in Norway would look very similar genetically to itself over thousands of years. However, that's comparing a population to a population. It will keep the same ratios of genes circulating, but individuals within the population will have random incidences of those genes, which like I noted earlier are far more numerous than racial marker genes, variance shared rather evenly across all humanity. Still, though, like the parents passing on their shared ancestry, because each has some identical genes, the little village will have kept that ancestral gene sequence for thousands of years, as northern Europe has kept the gene sequences for pale skin and milk-drinking for thousands of years. If you were Norwegian, comparing yourself to a 10,000 year old ancestor and a man from modern Zimbabwe, the odds are the longest gene sequences you'd have in common with either would be those \"racial\" differences. The rest of your genes would be a random, more generically human, scramble.", "labels": 1, "seconds_difference": 948.0, "score_ratio": 2.2083333333}

Light is a form of energy, but when you turn the light off, the light goes away, so where does the energy go?  The short answer is: it gets absorbed by the wall as heat.  The longer answer needs a bit of a more detailed mental picture. The wall is a solid, which consists of a (fairly) regular structure of atoms. Just imagine a grid of hard spheres laying against each other. This is the surface of the wall. At absolute zero, these atoms do not move and are simply at rest, one just touching the next. Having a temperature means that the wall contains ~~heat~~ *thermal energy*. This ~~heat~~ *thermal energy* is a random motion of the atoms around their equilibrium point, they're basically vibrating. Such a vibration can travel rather far through the lattice in the form of a wave. One ball pushes the next, which pushes the next, which pushes ... etc. Such a wave is commonly called a 'phonon', because it is also the way in which sound can move through solids.  Now think of the light. Light consists of tiny particles called photons, not to be confused with the phonons in the wall. Each photon is a tiny packet of electromagnetic energy and momentum. If such a photon hits (an atom of) the wall, its energy and momentum is absorbed. Since both these quantities need to be conserved, it means the atom will get a little \"kick\" from absorbing the photon. It will move, and kick against its neighbor, etc etc. So basically the photon has been converted into a phonon.  If enough photons get absorbed, this will result in the wall warming up slightly. So the light gets converted into ~~heat~~ *thermal energy* in the wall.  It's rather analogous to a stone falling into a lake. The energy of the stone will spread out over the surface of the water in the form of waves. The water itself doesn't move much, but the waves can carry the energy quite far. Likewise, the atoms don't move much, but the energy/momentum from the photons can carry rather deep into the wall.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 6836.0, "score_ratio": 141.45}

In the United States, half of new STIs occur among those ages 15-24. Meanwhile, increases in antimicrobial resistance are making it harder to treat and cure infections. STIs also represent a massive burden to the economy- in the United States alone, $16 billion is spent annually on STI-related health care costs.  But it's not all bad news! Screening programs are increasing around the world, mother to child transmission rates of diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis and HIV are decreasing, and effective treatments are continuing to be developed and delivered to patients in need.

However, in time he grew too old to continue, and used his magic to command mythical figures to fight for him. Because his name was Shazamo (pfffft AHAHAHA), he decided to choose immortal heroes whose names spelled out his own.   However, the O immortal, Oggar, wound up turning evil, so Shazamo cast him out, erased knowledge of him from existence, and even changed his own name to Shazam in defiance.  In time he realized he could do even more good if he granted all the heroes' powers to one singular Champion. By this time he'd *apparently* traded out his original batch for other immortals from a more recent civilization (Egypt). So he created Black Adam (this ended badly too. The Wizard is basically second only to the Guardians of Oa for screwing things up a long time ago).   Eventually, after the shame of creating Black Adam wore off, the Wizard chose another six immortals (Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury) and waited for a worthy champion to receive their powers. That was Billy. Later on he gave Billy's sister Mary a whole other suite of powers from another batch of immortals: Selene, Hippolyta, Ariadne, Zephyr, Aurora, and Minerva. Mary has also drawn from the same deities as Black Adam, but only after she turned evil and joined his side, implying that the divine powers at their disposal are limited by who they're aligned with.   \\*\\*\\*   Now, most of this is probably void as of the New 52, as our Wizard Shazamo has changed to an elderly Aboriginal shaman named Mamaragan.   Additionally, in very recent stories Billy has lost access to his original suite of powers and instead got a new batch from gods unique to the DC universe, mostly the New Gods.

{"post_id": "zfu5qv", "domain": "asksciencefiction_test", "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "history": "[MCU/Marvel] Why do superheroes not collaborate more/share resources in the marvel universe? I've been thinking about this alot especially as a big fan of the marvel movies. Why do the superheroes not share resources/technology or aid more with one another in the marvel universe? I want to be clear i absolutely love these movies and these characters but they seem to constantly go \"lone wolf\" and put themselves or their mission in danger when it is completely unnecessary. Even if it meant waiting to resolve the situation until help could arrive to ensure the best possible outcome  For example in Spiderman- No Way Home, Peter Parker struggles tremendously against the villains in that film and it costs him his aunt may and nearly MJ. He did at one point have the help of Dr. Strange but in fairness they had a disagreement on the proper resolution to the situation so i will allow that. Why didn't Peter make a phone call or send an Avengers SOS to Sam Wilson, Hulk, Hawkeye, Antman or any of the thousands of people that showed up in the Endgame battle? He did have the help of the other spidermen but at that point he had already lost his aunt. In Endgame we see that the heroes were able to regroup and rally into a large fighting force really quickly if the situation demands it. The multiverse was literally tearing itself apart. In Falcon and the Winter soldier we see that  Sam as the new Captain America had a pretty good handle on the situation but why not call Spider-man or Hulk for back up just in case? He clearly had to travel the long distance from Louisiana to New York, why not make a quick phone call to ask Avengers that might be nearby for help if they are available? If it meant saving more lives why not? Sam and Bucky are both military veterans and should know better than anyone the value of having a solid team and backup in any situation, regardless of how good of a handle you think you have on the situation.  Secondly, why dont the Avengers share technology and resources. We see in Falcon and the Winter Soldier that Sam is in dire financial straits due to the Avengers not actually paying him. Why is this? Even as an informal group why wouldn't Tony fund the group with paychecks and equipment? We see in Age of Ultron that he reformatted Stark tower into a makeshift base of operations. Why not make the Avengers unofficial stark employees so they could be compensated for their time? Peter seems to be the only one that received some manner of compensation in the form of a scholarship and a suit.  With regard to equipment i dont understand why Tony didn't give everyone a mini upgrade to their equipment. Spiderman receives an excellent nanotech suit but why didn't he give Captain America a suit that gives him a strength or speed boost? Hawkeye and Black Widow are incredibly skilled but a basic set of nanotech body armor, even without any bells and whistles would keep them much safer and maybe add a few additional tricks into their arsenal. I dont see why they would turn it down out of \"personal preference\" if it meant it an emergency situation that it might mean the difference between life and death for civilians or themselves. Quicksilver might've been saved incredibly easily if he was wearing a pretty basic Stark tech level set of body armor. Or Hawkeye could've saved himself if he had that shield generator that stark used in Endgame.  &#x200B;  For clarification im not saying the full might of the Avengers was necessary for every mugger and car crash. But for the big stuff... why dont they ask each other for help?", "c_root_id_A": "izdnjra", "c_root_id_B": "izdr59t", "created_at_utc_A": 1670492632, "created_at_utc_B": 1670495700, "score_A": 25, "score_B": 50, "human_ref_A": "In most cases, things usually happen so fast that the heroes doesn't have time to call anyone else.

Not having a super hero identity is the exception rather than the rule, so let's look at a few prominent cases:  * MCU Tony Stark - Ego. Pure ego. This explicitly puts him and his companions in danger which he later comes to regret and is motivation for a lot of his future ideas and upgrades. But at the time he \"came out\" it was basically narcisissm. * MCU Thor - Thor lives on Asgard and his human friends are mostly superheroes. Those that aren't are offered protection by SHIELD when a Thor-related threat arises. So there simply isn't a need for him to adopt a secret identity. * MCU Captain America - has no friends and family of note that aren't super heroes themselves that need special protection. * MCU Black Widow - Black Widow is basically *only* a \"secret\" identity. She has no public persona that would need hiding or protection. * Fantastic Four - Since the entire family and friends circle was made superhuman, there was simply no need to adopt secret identities for protection.

Peter still has people he cares about for deeply and if anyone knew who he was, they'd be targetted by criminals in order to punish him. For example, the Green Goblin found out that Gwen Stacy was linked to him and he kidnapped her to lure Spidey into a trap, leading to her death.  There's also at least two storylines where the Kingpin found out Spider-Man's identity and harmed/killed someone he cared for. In canon, someone tipped off the Kingpin about his being Peter Parker and he hired a sniper who wounded Mary Jane - in an issue of *What If?*, the sniper killed her instead which resulted in Spider-Man going on a warpath to kill Fisk.  Fisk ended up turning himself into the authorities for protection under the stipulend that an Avenger protect him from Spider-Man. This resulted in Iron Man going to fight Spidey... only for Peter to reveal that he had a remote shutdown secretly installed into his suit (this was years before this was confirmed to be canon, BTW). Then Fisk hired some dirty cops to hold May hostage to make him surrender. Spidey punched straight through Fisk's chest, ripped his heart out and told the cops that since they're no longer getting paid, they might as well leave! Then he lets the honest cops take him into custody.  In another storyline (which was canon), after Spidey's identity was made public, Fisk sent some goons around to rough up Aunt May, in such a way that it couldn't be tied to him (Fisk was in jail at the time).

Pound for pound there are few vessels that could contend with our star destroyers in an outright battle. However the rebels seemed to have realized long ago that said star destroyers have literally no point-defence weapons.   Meaning these giant goliaths of ships actually have had a glaring weakness since day one. Starfighters. Our slow-firing heavy-hitting turbolasers, which are manually aimed, have next to no chance of actually connecting with one of their most commonly encountered targets.  Now I understand that to make up for this weakness we are to deploy TIE fighter swarms. Unfortunately these have proven time and again to be inadequate against the proven superior rebel X-wing. Our TIE's have a larger surface area making them easier targets. No deflector shields or life support to speak of. No hyperdrive to chase down potential fleeing rebels. Not to mention weaker laser cannons than their already better defended X-wing counterparts. Ineffective, to say the least.

Not to worry. We'll get you brought up to speed on why our fleet is built this way, where we're going with it, and what we plan to do to plug this little... problem you've noticed.  The first thing is to remember that while we are the Imperial Navy, quite a bit of our hardware and doctrine are a result of the disastrous clone wars and the collapse of the old republic. Older ships like the Venator class carried large wings of starfighters, but were comparatively poorly armed in ship to ship combat. At the same time, starfighters of that era really weren't a proper threat to capital ships. Oh, in large enough numbers they could do some damage, I grant you, but they really weren't a threat. Separatist ships, as well as the ships used by other mongrel forces on the rim were often poorly shielded, but carried heavy firepower that could mission kill if not destroy a Venator or an Acclimator in short order.  As a result of the founding of our New Order, the Imperial Navy made the design decision to roll out our Imperial I and II SD's to reinvigorate our fleet and give it a proper ship to ship punch, as well as reduce the vulnerability of our troop transports. Finally, it was also decided (in order to properly take advantages of the economies of scale that we are afforded by key contractors such as Sinear and Kuat), to work to build a single \"one ship fits all\" solution. That gets us our Imperial Star Destroyer. While Grand Moff Tarkin was rolling out his doctrine, (and it does dovetail nicely in with the ISD's design concepts), the ISD as a whole came first by several years. That's why they're everywhere.  At the same time, the effectiveness of hordes of light fighters wasn't entirely lost on us, and the simple truism is that a fighter or ship can only ever be on one place at any one time. So our focus on rolling out TIE fighters allows us to field large numbers in any engagement. While yes, they aren't the equal of rebel designs (which were in fact designed thanks to funding BY the Imperial Navy, before the design teams defected) on a one to one basis, they provide significant benefits during other-than-fleet-action operations. TIE fighters can be providing top cover while conducting ground operations, provide support for customs teams, and be standing roving patrols all while maintaining a sufficient reserve to account for maintenance downtimes.  I understand that at this time, this is rather cold comfort when your ships are having to deal with rebel hit and fade attacks, but that is the galaxy we're living in. Were the past different, we may already have begun to field comparable fighters to the rebel X-Wing multirole fighter.   Ah. I'm sure you've noticed that little turn of phrase there. \"May already\". We here at Fleet Command aren't entirely blind to the problem these rag tag rebels have revealed, and we are indeed working on countermeasures. But introducing new fighters or other doctrines take time. We have to be able to support the hardware we put into the field, otherwise we might as well blow it up ourselves and save the trouble of the rebels swooping in and destroying it and Vader knows what else!  But I digress. I'm afraid we cannot disclose any more than that. Please stay up to date as new information comes down from Command via your holonet fleet updates, and continue to suppress and crush any rebel forces you encounter.

The first time he went to get the infinity gems, at the time known as the soul gems...he got them.

It's where the government says, by decree, that something must be traded for \"exactly X\" (or more than X, or less than X).  It somewhat defeats the market process - instead of something getting more expensive as it gets scarcer or increases in demand, it simply runs out of stock. Or vice versa, you end up with more for sale than can be sold, with the producers unable to sell their wares.  Everyone price controls to some degree though - a minimum wage is an example, rent control in some markets are another example. There are academic defences of the minimum wage, but we'd all be lying if we were to say there's no disadvantages/problems caused by it.  The point of all this, is that Venezuela for a long time has been attempting to price control *everything*. From the price of toilet paper, through to wages, through to electricity, through to even the currency itself.  The latter is a huge one. In Venezuela, the currency must be exchanged for USD at a price decreed by the government. This isn't a fixed exchange rate in the traditional sense (where the central bank builds up \"reserves\" and then sells them at a fixed price) - Venezuela has attempted to do the same purely through decree. The problem with this, is that they overvalue the currency so much that you can't actually trade at the official rate. Nobody (or few) will sell you USD for the price the government says they must.  Markets are all incredibly interconnected, we all depend on foreign trade for prosperity - but even operating a business in Venezuela you're shut out from all of this. Only well connected individuals can buy USD from the government at the official rate, otherwise you're stuck applying for \"allowances\" through application processes that take who-knows-how-long. This means the only way to actually import en-masse in Venezuela is by breaking the law. Using black market currency traders. Can you imagine running a business like that?  Oh. Not that you'd want to operate a business - as per the toilet paper article, if the government feels you're not running with the country's interests at heart, it'll just seize it. This makes everyone incredibly suspicious about investing in the country, and avoiding it completely.  So you have inability to export, inability to import, inability to set your own prices, a government that will seize your company on a whim... all acting to reduce \"aggregate supply\". There's chokes on absolutely everything - you cannot buy foreign stuff, you cannot employ workers except at wages decreed by government, and then you can't even sell your goods except at prices also decreed by the government.  Anyway. With trashed supply, come shortages and/or raising prices (price controls be damned). The government attempts to address all these by bringing in tougher price controls, but they're doomed to fail too. Their economy is choked from top to bottom by controls on everything, people can't produce stuff, can't sell stuff, etc. And with a weak economy comes a low (and falling) exchange rate. Well, it would, except that's price controlled too (so read: falling black market exchange rate).  Then hit oil price crashes. Venezuela has more oil than anyone else (which goes to show how spectacularly shockingly they're being run), which accounts for nearly all their exports - again no doubt largely due to the illegality of currency exchange. So oil price crashes, and their entirely non-diversified economy sinks with it.  Adding on to all of these (even with terrible management economies tend to persevere until there's a combination of things - they're nowhere near as fragile as we think), they've been hit by the worst drought in 47 years. With the drought 3 years running, their dams are now on the brink of empty. For a country that depends on hydro for 73% of their power generation, that's a *huge problem*. One that undoubtedly could have been avoided with better management and contingency planning, but Venezuela has anything but good management.  So what do they do? Well, reduce the number of workdays. Send people home from public sector jobs. Roll blackouts. All things further constricting aggregate supply, further making it harder/impossible to run a business.  With reduced aggregate supply, you can basically either take measures to reduce aggregate demand (like raising taxes), or let inflation erode people's living standards for you. The latter can be extra problematic, as inflation means lower real interest rates, encouraging people to spend further: it can *increase* aggregate demand and trigger all kinds of terrible feedback loops (like getting wage increases due to inflation due to wage increase, etc). Venezuela has all that, but then also a bunch of price controlled stuff experiencing shortages, and just generally the economy is undergoing a slow collapse. It's fascinating to watch.  Oh. And I forgot another big one: they happen to owe a lot of foreign currencies. Somehow, the country needs to bring in USD to repay those public debts. Combine that with the collapse in the export sector, collapse in the electricity sector, massive inflation and shortages out of the wazoo... and yeh, good luck to them with that.  If you ask me (and I'm definitely no authority on the matter), one of the biggest mistakes they made was price controlling their currency. Currencies should be free floating, fixed or managed if you absolutely must, but making it illegal to trade except at a government-determined rate is just the worst possible system excusable never. Argentina until last year had the same system and there is just really not a single thing to recommend it for. Well, that and/or deciding to seize businesses willy-nilly. Actually, that latter one's probably even worse. Sigh.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 6289.0, "score_ratio": 55.0}

Then I started studying Soci and my entire perspective on the world changed. It opened my eyes and forced me to look beyond my tunnel vision of society. It was really hard at times to come to terms with things that I thought I already understood, especially social issues that I had never thought about before or issues that had always been presented to me in a one-sided, biased manner.  A good example of this is the trope of the Welfare Queen. I was told that poor people, esp. poor black people, were moochers and only wanted handouts because they were lazy and didn't want to get a job. Of course, I learned that the Welfare Queen (and welfare \"fraud\") is a myth that was promulgated by Ronald Regan in order to stigmatize people in poverty so that he could convince Americans that rolling back the social safety net was justified because it was only being used by poor black (read: undeserving) citizens. The truth is that most people on welfare *do* have jobs (i.e. the 'working poor'). Also, the welfare reforms of 1996 created a 5-year maximum lifetime cap on benefits so that welfare \"cheaters\" (which did not exist anywhere near the level that we're often told) were literally unable to collect benefits for life (also, contrary to popular opinion, women do not have more babies to get more benefits. In fact, if a woman has a child *while* receiving benefits, she and her family will be removed from the rolls). Welfare is probably one of the least understood/mischaracterized social issue in American society.   Science in general is often met with the sting of anti-intellectualism, which is part of the answer to your question. However, I think *social* science in particular gets it worse than the 'natural' sciences like Biology and Chemistry. I used to say that it was because people were generally more suspect of social sciences, but I think it's more than that. People like to dismiss facts about social issues that they don't agree with or have a different view on because it's much easier to disagree that we live in a post-racial society (we don't) than it is to disagree on the functions of bodily organs. People also tend to conflate their individual life experiences with overall reality (i.e. \"well, i've never experienced blank] so it must not be true or its exaggerated\" or \"well, I know someone who is [blank] but [blank] doesn't happen to them\"). You get what I am saying here? Most people don't question or critically think about social norms or commonsense 'truths' because these 'truths' are so embedded in our milieu that its hard to imagine otherwise. So instead of thinking critically, people dismiss sociological knowledge as either \"elitist\" or \"not real science\" so that they can remain undisturbed in their own little worlds.   Once I saw a question on r/askreddit that asked what the slogan of your college major or job would be. I would say, \"Sociology: reminding people of uncomfortable truths since 1838\" or \"Sociology: everything you were taught about society was a big lie\" lol.

Why are these laws not considered racist/discriminatory? (Not intended to be inflammatory, respectful discussion please) I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, so please shoot me down if I'm ruining your wonderful sub (although if you could point me in the right direction first, I'd greatly appreciate it).  My question is not intended to be racist or inflammatory, and at the risk of sounding condescending I'd like to plead for discussion to be civil and for upvotes etc. to be alloted by reason rather than emotion. I'd also like to clarify that I am not North American, but recently visited a relative of mine in Canada and learnt, in broad strokes, about the race laws there. I'd like to share the experience as it adds context to my question; feel free to skip to the end to see my question on its own.  I visited my cousin when he got married in Toronto. He's white and Irish (1st gen immigrant), and his girlfriend is also white, originally from the Ukraine. They had lived there for about 10 years. She worked as a teacher on a Native American (or American Indian, I'm afraid I don't know what term is appropriate, apologies if I cause offense) reservation (I think she used a better name for it, apologies again). I was quite surprised by many things I learnt. According to her, many people in the native community are exempt from various taxes, and receive free education up to and including University (unlike other Canadians in that prefecture), and also benefit from various other favoritist policies based on race. However, to qualify for the full benefits (which could include ownership of land), you had to be at least n% American Indian - if your bloodline was too watered down, you no longer qualified.  I was quite surprised by this, because it didn't seem fair at all. First of all, there's something a bit grim about your birth (and your % indigenous blood) determining your relationship to the state etc.; I like to think that in a developed country, the law, rights, and duties should apply to all equally regardless of race. I was also distressed by my relative's reaction to my surprise. They reasoned that since they were white, it was fair - they'd oppressed the Indians in their own day, and it was time to pay reparations. However, this argument didn't make sense to me. First of all, many taxpayers (who are footing the bill for indigenous privilege) are non-white. They might be Japanese Canadians, who were hideously mistreated very recently, or just recent immigrants from China or Bangladesh who've never done anything wrong to the indigenous people. I also pointed out that a Ukrainian and an Irishman have also probably done nothing wrong (historically speaking) - heck, almost no-one suffered so much at the hands of the British as the Irish, and Ukraine hasn't exactly had a fun 150 years either. Finally, I pointed out that really, guilt shouldn't be inherited, and race laws don't really have a place in a first world country.  My relatives reaction is what surprised me the most, and what lead me to ask this question. They became very defensive and actually angry at me. I honestly felt as if they'd been brainwashed. I must admit, I don't understand the Canadian educational system at all, but it seems like it's trying to make people feel guilt - or worse, actually BE guilty - of crimes they have not committed. What is also strange is that they objected to my use of the term 'race law' in reference to laws which specifically stipulate different treatment by the law based on race.  I am given to understand that the USA has similar policies, for instance permitting Native Americans to circumvent various state and federal laws, again based on bloodline (Casinos spring to mind).  I was surprised to discover that Canada and the USA have different legal treatment for different races, and I have the impression that mainstream society doesn't question this much. Am I correct in that impression? What is the discussion in the field of social science of the validity of having 'preferred' races, 'tax exempt' races, etc.? Doesn't serious social science frown upon 'race' as a construct anyway, and if so, why hasn't that attitude permeated society as a whole? Finally, is opposing such policies considered racist?  TL;DR: Explain race laws in Canada and the USA, affirmative action, and social attitudes towards the same; please remain civil!

So my short answer will be heavily dependent on the few things I have read.   They are probably more similar than they are different, at least in method. But I think the main difference would be largely decided by the nature of the question you are asking. Of course there is much overlap, but my guess is that the difference between the kinds of questions Anths and Socs will be interested in is deeply influenced by the history of those disciplines. If your ethnography is about kinship, identity, etc - it will tend towards the Anth, while if you are asking how people make sense of institutions or social classes, that's more sociological. Annette Lareau and Michael Burawoy are two of the most prominent examples of Sociological Ethnographers. But again, my guess is that they have in a sense grown MORE similar, at least over the last 30-40 years, as anthropologists have become more interested in systems and macro issues (and not just the 'natives on the island'). Likewise, sociological ethnogs would probably be more willing to pay attention to local interactions after the Cultural turn in the 1970s and the distancing from positivist epistemology.   But this historical trajectory is a little misleading I think because many of the very earliest sociologists were indeed highly qualitative (and women) and it was only after an obsession with quant data from census etc that qualitative methods fell out of style in Sociology for a while.   The Extended Case Method (from Max Gluckman and the Machester school) is an interesting development in itself. It began in anthropology but then fell out of style as the Geertzian interpretivist tradition because the sin qua non of american anthro. But then Burawoy and a few other sociologists picked it up in an attempt to write ethnographies that dealt with local interactions but also took seriously the macro contexts that shaped the local situations.   I think the type of question and the assumption about who the 'members' (i.e. the ethnos) are will see an ethnography tend in one or the other direction. If the members are connected by institutional, class, race or other (larger) relationships - and the ethnographer is trying to say something about SOCIETY - then it's more sociological. If the relationships are village/location, family, etc it may be more anthro.   As I am thinking through this, I can probably come up with lots of points that refute what I have said.

However in actuality, some studies have shown that much of the population is actually genetically mestizo.   The Goths, Vandals and other German ethnolinguistic groups, were eventually subsumed into the modern German ethnicity.   The Gauls in pre-Roman Europe were a tribal ethnic group that were subsumed into the invading Roman Empire. Becoming \"Romanized\" (although I hate the use of that word) through imperial conquest and forced subjugation.   So yes there are many examples of ethnic groups merging and becoming one, or one being subsumed into the other. It has happened all across the world, but for varying reasons. Yes, there are many ethnic groups that strive to protect their linguistic and cultural heritage but given enough time and proximity, and the right historical circumstances, it is not uncommon to see a merging of ethnic groups. I think the biggest thing to wrap your head around is that these are long term historical events. This isn't something that happens in a few generations.   Some Sources:  * Corach, D. et. al. (2010).

A great example is European countries, where historically, there have been hundreds or thousands of ethnic groups living in a particular country. However, over time, those particular ethnic distinctions have been forgotten, with everyone instead embracing the idea of \"Dutch,\" \"French,\" or \"German.\" This is the product of nationalism, but nationalism can be a powerful force in bringing people together.  An example without nationalism is the Ngoni of southern Africa. As the Ngoni conquered surrounding peoples, they absorbed them into their class structure, first as a lower caste, then integrating them more fully. However, in doing so, Ngoni gods, beliefs, and even names would change as Ngoni adopted things they liked from the groups they conquered. This definitely isn't unique in African history either - southern African groups tended to absorb rather than annihilate each other.   You can still see this going on with Islam and Christianity in Africa. Rather than the Christianity or Islam you might recognise, the faiths are instead full of recontextualising, with Jesus or Allah taking on a traditional African role and being one among many. It's an extremely common phenomenon for converted peoples to incorporate indigenous beliefs with the converting religion, creating a blend of the two to better contextualise the faith and incorporate it into their identity. It's not quite an example of what you're looking for, but it really highlights why merges happen - people think other people have good ideas and good ways of looking at the world, and blend those ideas together to create a stronger whole.", "labels": 1, "seconds_difference": 3411.0, "score_ratio": 1.3}

I've worked for governments, businesses, and even done some bits of work for the World Bank. I also just got back from a course on international standards in regulatory analysis. This should get you started on how to tear apart any new regulation or law.   I'm referencing my documents and notes that I took while taking this international course taught by European professors of public policy, World Bank leaders, and regulatory consultants.   A full outline of the current ideal policy development process can be found here. This is the process that is followed in many Western countries to varying degrees of quality and depth. It's frequently not followed for laws, but it makes a useful tool for tearing them apart.   The UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, EU, and other countries, regularly produce IA statements for new regulations, so you can see their whole process.   The first question that needs to be asked every single time you look at a policy or law and above all before anything else is:  What is the problem?   A policy should always clearly lay out exactly what the problem is and what are the root causes of the problem. Is it too many people are dying in road accidents? Businesses are unable to compete in a specific market? Too many people are getting sick from tainted food?   It's critical that the problem is defined as an adverse affect on people (bad health outcomes, lower wages/wealth, etc).   Mindbogglingly, the problem that the policy is trying to solve is sometimes not clearly defined at all, or even worse the problem as its defined is that there is no policy.   Second, you should look at the objective of the policy. The policy should draw a very clear relationship between the problem, the causes of the problem, and the objective of the policy. Do the objectives of the policy actually line up with the identified problem and causes? Again, you would be surprised how often this isn't true.   Consider a law/policy to increase drug possession penalties:  Too many people are sick or injured from doing recreational drugs, because access to drugs is too easy, because recreational drugs aren't illegal enough. Is this link actually well identified? Is it supported by evidence at all?   So, if the problem is well-defined and the objectives of the policy make sense then you get to look at possible options. Have the policy makers identified a wide range of policy options? Honestly, this basically never happens. Departments and ministries are often constrained to their mandate and other laws, so broader, more effective policies are often completely ignored. Many policies are written with the policy option in mind, so this step is ignored completely. Think of a law that increases penalties for drug possession (e.g. more jail time).   The problem is that many adverse health outcomes are the result of some recreational drug use. Governments almost universally just look at increasing penalties for drug possession or trafficking, but its really obvious that they should at least consider other policy options. Why not treat more drug addicts to reduce the impact on human health? Why not spend more educating people on adverse health effects?  Okay, so let's say that now we have a problem, objectives to fix the problem, and a number of solutions. If the policy makes sense so far, it's actually doing better than most. But now, the policy makers need to convince you that they've properly captured and weighed all of the benefits and costs of the policy options. There are lots of possible questions here:   How sound is the analysis? Was their any analysis at all? Are there lots of unverified assumptions? Are all stakeholders considered? (A stakeholder is any person, industry, or economic actor that may be affected by the policy) Is the analysis transparent enough to know how they weighed the costs and benefits? Did the policy makers undertake sufficient public consultation? Are all of the costs and benefits properly accounted for? Etc.  Honestly, this part of regulatory development is an art into itself. Just weighing the costs and benefits of a new law or regulation can be extremely challenging.   For lots of regulations, you can actually look at all of these things through the impact assessment documents.  Next, did the policy makers choose the right option given their analysis? It should be absolutely crystal clear from their analysis. For many laws, there is no analysis or more frequently only closed-door consultations. Policy makers often do not provide sufficient rational at all for their final option, and do not make even the most basic results from consultations public.   So, even if the government has a policy. How will the government enforce the policy? Obviously a new regulation or law needs someone to make sure people/businesses comply. Also, are the results of the policy/law going to be tracked to see if its effective? Will the policy be scrapped if it's found to be costly and ineffective?  So let's say that increasing recreational drug penalties is a legitimate option. How will the government actually enforce this? Make more jail space? increase police budgets? Is the government going to see if it's an effective policy and drop it if it isn't?   ----------------------------------  As you can probably imagine, most laws, even in well-developed countries, will abysmally fail a lot of these questions.

For example, agent based stock markets will generate fat-tailed return distributions and PE ratios that are close to what we would expect from the real world.

Here is a relevant excerpt:  >The problem with this argument is that Marx was very clear that labor has to be useful labor to create value. Yet he didn't think that it was this usefulness that creates value. Labor has been doing useful things for millennia. All societies are made up of useful labor. Marx calls this useful labor that makes up a society \u201csocial labor\u201d. The organization of this social labor differs from society to society. In a capitalist society this social labor is organized through the commodity exchange: the products of labor are assigned market values and the fluctuations of these values coordinate the social labor process. This is a way of organizing social labor unique to capitalism and it has all sorts of unique properties that other forms of social labor don\u2019t have. The usefulness of labor is not what is specific to capitalism. Value is. Hence, usefulness is not what Marx interested in talking about. Value is.", "human_ref_B": "First off let's separate prices from value.   Value in Marx has two forms. True value (ie. the value produced by the addition of labour to natural materials which is what gives you the famous reinterpretation of Ricardo's value theory) and value within the commodity system (given by the M-C-M (money - commodity - money)). To Marx the system of valuation within the commodity system, which could easily be subjective value, is a mask over the intrinsic value of a good such as it's value as natural capital and the human and machine labour required to turn it into a commodity. Most people miss the fact that Marx makes this differentiation from Ricardo. Within the commodity system commodities no longer have their true value. They have the value ascribed to them by the desire of capitalists to turn money into commodities and commodities into money. Today we would probably call the actualization of these desires advertising, branding and marketing.  He's basically arguing that if we want to know what something is really worth, we have to look at the material inputs and forces that are effected on nature in order to turn it into a commodity. Subjective value is all fine and good but commodities have a material reality that is independent of people. A loom is different than a horse even if there are no people to say that one is worth more than the other. It's important to remember that Marx is a materialist so for him economics has to be based on observable properties of the material world, so he's arguing against relativism and idealist conceptions of value.   Prices on the other hand are determined by the costs of materials and the costs of labour plus the natural rate of profit (or surplus value) that is determined by society. Basically he says prices are determined by input costs plus a profit margin which is basically how most firms determine their prices (with of course the obvious exception of cartels, de facto cartels, duopolies and monopolies).", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 75639.0, "score_ratio": 1.6666666667}

The fair market value is the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. The fair market value of a particular item of property includible in the decedent's gross estate is not to be determined by a forced sale price.

Now I've been thinking about social networks and virtual communities for a long time. Recently I had a debate with a friend about the development of Facebook, and how it may eventually fade away. Our conclusion was that moves away from FB by users could be modeled by accounting for the following variables (applicable to those who are currently on FB):  1. The relative \"entrenchment\" of users - time on the website overall, average time weekly spent, amount of information posted (storage in bytes, mb, or gb).  2. The number of people they have \"friended\" who are heavy content creators (invocation of the supposed 1% rule.)  3. The number of strong relationships maintained through FB.  Now this is nothing academic - we didn't base our **very** rough \"model\" on previous studies, or collected data. We were just shooting the shit! The next day, I see this above article and I found it very interesting - these folks are taking a virus-spread epidemiological model (much more firmly established than conversation over beers). According to their lit review, application of the SIR model can be applied using Google Trends data to monitor and predict the relative life of a disease. In this instance, Facebook is the disease, and they want to use Google Trend data to predict its life.  They then go on to validate this approach by applying it to MySpace which has, as they argue, a \"..full life cycle.\" I love elegant, simple models - they tend to have broader reliability than adding in all the variables I suggested above. However this approach to me is reminiscent of the invasion-succession model in social ecology (adopted, of course, from biological life sciences). The model has some broad applications, but seems to lack nuance - showing weakness especially with regards to matters like gentrification and some rental patterns.  So, to the thoughts/questions I have for discussion: Is applying the SIR (their method specifically called irSIR) going to be a useful method for roughly estimating the life cycles of virtual social networks? What instances are there where this method may fall flat? Can this model be adjusted to incorporate \"stability\" effectively, or does its reliance on Search Trend Data limit its effectiveness? By stability, I am thinking of MySpace - it's still around, not nearly as big, but has a user population (no idea how static that number is, or how we would capably capture that). Does the irSIR model misleadingly suggest that the disease is more or less gone which in fact it is still around?  Finally, on theory nuance - predicting social diseases like FB (I'm sorry for the narrative language on this one, I admit to thinking of social developments as spreading viruses both funny but accurate on some level) - can a social disease like FB achieve a lot of saturation but maintain relatively high stability? For example, if the majority of 30+ users currently on FB **largely** maintain their presence for the next 20 years or so (controlling for attrition through natural processes), would the irSIR model still be useful in predicting its decline? It seems to rely on search trend data, so my thinking is not necessarily. In this instance, it seems like a more nuanced, researched model may yield broader insights into the spread of the disease itself.  Any thoughts on the irSIR model applied to FB would be appreciated. Ideas on how we could more capably model life cycle patterns in virtual communities in general would also be great.", "human_ref_B": "Hey there I have a question regarding design and methods.

AFAIK in an experimental design for example, you are able to control and adjust the effect of the independant variable, and therefore overcome it.

I've been taking him to the vet for months now.  6 1/2 year old border collie mix. We live in southern Wisconsin. He has two perfectly healthy doggie siblings.  He started last October with just not being his happy hungry self, so vet expressed his anal glands.  He continued to not eat much, appetite comes and goes. He started to yelp when we would pet him, but every few days the spot with pain would change.  He had stool and urine samples, blood tests, x-ray and ultrasound. Nothing conclusive. Sometimes protein levels would be high, sometimes they weren't. Sometimes he had bacteria, sometimes he didn't.  He started getting open sores, crusty spots, fur falling in clumps, random lumps under his skin. Some seemed to be by his lymph nodes, one was along his spine.  He is NOT itching, and only occasionally does some licking. Scrapings taken from spots and biopsy of lumps. No mites, no obvious reason for the sores and scabs. Biopsy inconclusive. They couldn't rule out lymphoma, but there was nothing strongly indicating it.  He does have a low grade fever and high white blood cell count.  There are new sores popping up on a daily basis. I'm currently waiting on results from \"better\" tests.  We've done two kinds of antibiotics with no improvement. Other than that, pain pills that don't really seem to help.

Just a little back story, I rescued my Male pit bull from animal services 6 years ago when he was approximately 3 years old. He was found on the street positive with heart worms, he was treated after I adopted him and made a full recovery from that.   About 5 months ago He developed a fatty ball on his belly button just above his penis. Probably the size of half an orange fruit. Very squishy and he didn\u2019t seem to be bothered when I touch it .  2 days ago he started acting a little weird as in not eating as much when typically he finishes his whole bowl.   Yesterday he through up what looked like, brown almost digested food.  On our walk this afternoon I noticed he was bloated and then I checked his belly and the fatty bump was gone. There was probably a little tiny bit of fatty lump the size of a dime that was left. He wasn\u2019t acting normal either. Decided to take him directly to the vet.  Finally they call me in to the room to be seen after waiting an hour.   The vet came in and saw my dog laying on the floor and the first thing he said was how he could tell immediately my dog is very sick. Vet checked his mouth, very pale. Vet Explained his blood is not traveling. Vet checked poop, looks fine. I did tell the vet about the lump. After one abdominal X-ray the vet immediately knew something was wrong. Took me back to explain the Xray. There\u2019s a mas and fluid pushing his organs. The vet thinks it\u2019s terminal cancer. Vet said it could be liver, not really sure. This vet is very blunt and has been around for a very long time. Vet was explaining that we would need to find out what\u2019s killing him. Recommended a ultra sound but also stated we wouldn\u2019t really know unless they went in with surgery. I also want to mention after the vet checked his blood he seemed like he was blown away at how normal it was. The vet had mentioned anemia killing him but once he looked at the blood he dropped that possible diagnoses. This vet visit was pretty much all over the place and very emotional for me.   Ending diagnosis was a mas in his abdomen bleeding and fluid in his abdomen.  DR left me with a choice to put my dog down which he recommended or to take My dog home and he will die at home tonight. And the vet mentioned my dog will slip into a coma state.   I asked the vet if he was in pain, he said no. decided to take my dog home. The doctor didn\u2019t want to give him medication or even stick a needle to drain anything as he didn\u2019t want to worsen the situation.   Also before we left the vet did ask if he got into any toxic things or medication as it causes things like this. My dog isn\u2019t really known to eat anything that isn\u2019t food. He\u2019s very well behaved.    I thought about this whole experience alot and it seems like what it\u2019s coming down to is $$ to be able to diagnose properly. So I called around to get an ultrasound but since it\u2019s night time no one is available even at emergency clinics.   The plan is to keep him alive through the night so we can atleast do an ultra sound to hopefully get a Diagnosis in the morning.   When we got home I cooked up 2 eggs for my dog and he ate them with no hesitation and also drank a good amount.  Despite him seeming weak and wanting to lay down he raises his head and gave kisses to my nephew who came over to see him.  This dog is loved by many and I do not want to give up on him easy just because he is a dog. I looked at my mom and told her putting him down wouldn\u2019t be an option if this was a human child .  We\u2019ve been through so much together and I can tell he is trying his hardest to hold on. It just sucks that I feel like money is meaning life or death for him.

I'm at a loss of how to help our new pup. We adopted Mackenzie 15 weeks ago from a shelter. They think she's about 2.5-3 years old. She had a horrible past, they found her in a sewage drain with a litter of her own puppies when she was about ten months old. They were able to adopt out the puppies, but she was left behind in the shelter. They told me that they often had to trick and force her to go back into the kennel after her outside time was over.  The first time we met her we couldn't touch her because of how skittish she was. Now, she's gotten a ton better since then and will cuddle on the bed and even greet some of the people that come into the house. It's been a remarkable improvement that I didn't expect to happen for a very long time. However, we're dealing with another issue that I'm worried will affect her physical health.   She's still scared of many things like being outside at night and the lights going on or off inside, and she might be scared of doorways. We\u2019re having some problems interpreting all her behavior.Unfortunately, because of this, she likes to hide in her kennel or the side of the bed. This would be fine, except that she doesn't want to leave the hiding spot to go potty (even during the day time) and she isn't going potty in the house either. We can't bribe her to come out with treats or lure her out with the neighbor's dog inside the house for play time (she loves playing with this dog outside). We've tried putting her on a double leash with our other dog so they walk together to the door, but she won't even stand up. So we have to pick her up and carry or pull her out of the spot and bring her outside. I know this is traumatic for her, but I don't know what else to do. It would be easier if she would just pee inside, but she won't. We tried waiting her out and leaving the door open to see if she'd go outside on her own, but after 12 hours hours we have to force her out. We once waited until 18 hours, but she won't go outside. Once she is outside, she's happy. She runs around and plays with the other dogs. We give lots of treats and play time.  When she's indoors she will leave her spots for food, water, and attention, but when we move to open the door she hides again. Sometimes when we approach her outside of her hiding spots she will run away from us, other times she wags her tail and waits for pets.  I know we're making it worse by forcing the transition, but I'm worried if we just keep waiting it out that she'll have bladder problems. My husband wants to block off her hiding spots, but I don't want to take away the places she feels safe. We have been doing confidence building activities and lots of positive association with her known fears, but it isn't working fast enough for her to transition from her safe space to outside on her own and each time we force it I think we make it worse.

However, as a tax payer, I'm outraged that these large corporations are getting these handouts from the government and getting rewarded for their greedy behavior. The bank bailouts of 08 made me sick and I can't believe we're doing this again. Millions of Americans lost their jobs and their homes due to the bank's irresponsible and illegal behavior, and yet all these bankers made out with millions.  Take the airline industry for example. 96% of their Free Cash Flow was spent on stock buybacks this past decade. These C-suite executives and investors made millions off this type of behavior despite not creating any type of value for both the company and for their employees. If your company can't last a few months of stagnant revenue, you shouldn't be spending all that money on buybacks and dividends. Especially when a large reason these companies found so much excess money in the last couple years was an egregious gifted tax cut from the government. Sure no one could have foreseen the current environment, but nearly every economist was predicting a recession within the next few years. They should have prepared for some type of downturn.   Furthermore, this punishes the companies that actually acted responsibly with their capital. In normal circumstances, this would be their opportunity to gain market share and even buy up some of the failing companies. Instead, they are robbed of this opportunity. The way our market works is that feedback is all seen through the lens of risk and reward. When a company decides to spend almost all of their profits on buybacks, they are taking the risk that a black swan event in the future can cause bankruptcy. Now we are removing the incentive for prudent decision making for companies. What's to stop companies of only acting recklessly since they know the government will always bail them out?  Lastly, lots of small businesses are going bankrupt everyday. Where are their bailouts? Why should large companies with every advantage in the world be given this lifeline for acting so irresponsibly, when normal everyday people struggling to get by are not allotted this same opportunity.  Before anyone says it, I understand bailouts are not free money. They're a loan by the government. But the interest rates are typically much lower than they would command in the free market. The government should either charge a high interest rate to compensate for that risk, or inject money into these companies through equity investments that could be put in a blind trust. At least in this scenario, the bailout is seen through the lens of a prudent investment. It's also pricing in the risks of investing in these companies since we never know what will happen to them in the future. If they don't want it, they can find someone else to give them money or go bankrupt. It's not like these companies will just disappear, there will be a buyer somewhere out there.   No one is ENTITLED to a low interest loan from the government, especially these mega corporations who barely pay above minimum wage for their lowest employees while constantly upping the C-suite's compensation. By handing out bailouts that actually reflect the risk for these companies, we can actually punish the C-Suite and investors who squeezed every bit of profit out of the company during good times since these deals will negatively affect the stock price.

If your company can't last a few months of stagnant revenue, you shouldn't be spending all that money on buybacks and dividends.  The airline industry was impacted far more than most other businesses because they have the opposite seasonality to most trades. Most firms make the most money over the Christmas / winter period (hence 'Black Friday'), so when the shutdowns hit, they were still riding high on their Christmas trading.  In contrast, most airlines lose money over the autumn / winter, and make it all back during the summer. So when the shutdown hit, they were at their absolute lowest period and were now completely deprived of the ability to bring their balance sheets back into line.   So this wasn't 'a few months of stagnant revenue' it was 'the period of the year in which we cover all our costs and debt interest has been completely removed.'

I believe this is wrong and should be ended. It is unjust to force someone to pay for a child that isn't theirs unless they were in the know to begin with and a legal adoption took place.

Say that they track the biological father down and force *him* to start paying - well now he's just paying the other dad because of a mistake (or even malevolence on the part of the mother) and the child isn't getting anything.  Child support is ostensibly about the children. It's not about giving the mother money for having the kid, it's about the cost of raising a child and how we as a society have decided to approach the subject. If you start forcing someone in a situation that is receiving child support to themselves pay some form of child support there's only one person you're actually harming here - the child.

I find the first purpose to be really insulting to the people of the countries missionaries travel to. It sends a message that these people cannot possibly choose the best religious beliefs (or lack thereof) for themselves and need the \"help\" of missionaries to follow the \"right\" religion. These trips almost always take place in impoverished areas of the world and to me it feels like the \"saying the quiet part out loud\" in this situation would be to say that the people who go on these trips believe that poor people are stupid and easy to prey on. The source I read (linked in the first paragraph) specifically says \"many of the countries most in need of the gospel are also full of poverty, and places filled with poverty are also filled with vulnerable people\". It seems that they mean that these people are easier to convert because they are often in crisis situations and are desperate. Some go so far as to go on these trips to build a church rather than something that the community needs.  I believe that the second reason people go on these trips, physical service work, is also problematic. While the source says that you *sometimes* need medical training or degrees to do medical mission trips, it also talks about trips focusing on construction and education which you do *not* need training or degrees in. Most of the people who go on these trips are under 25 years old. It is very unlikely at these ages that they have the skills necessary to perform these tasks which means that they are potentially building unsafe structures and improperly teaching children. I also believe this is bad because it takes work away from the locals and costs more money. Rather than paying to fly yourself out there, paying for housing and meals, and using a community's resources, why not just donate money so that local people can do the work? Would it not make more sense to pay for the supplies so that a local contractor can build a school or pay for a local person's education so that they can become a teacher rather than untrained college aged people doing this work? Without paying for your own expenses, you'd have more money to give as well.  To me, it seems like these trips serve the people who go on them more than the people they say they want to help.

Anecdote isn't data, but a local church here built a sister church in South America approximately 15 years ago.

I'm writing this because while in my experience condemnation of or at least acknowledgement of the toxicity, hatefulness, and bad advice-full-ness of \"manosphere\" subs or communities focused around The Red Pill, Pick Up Artistry, or Men Going Their Own Way is nearly universal among people who are not in those communities, I have seen a fair number of people who are not r/FemaleDatingStrategy users come to the defense of FDS with comments like \"oh they're just focused on helping women not get taken advantage of and ensuring they get the most out of dating, there's nothing wrong with that!\"  This kind of positive outsider view of FDS culminated in an article the Wall Street Journal published about FDS in which they praised the sub for offering \"actually practical advice in the age of dating apps,\" because \"Today\u2019s Tinderella must swipe through a lot of ugly profiles to find her prince,\" and claiming that \"The strategies that FDSers endorse, particularly for online dating, are backed by scientific research\" and concluding that \"If love is a battlefield, communities like Female Dating Strategy are trying to better arm some of the combatants.\"  I find it very hard to believe that a major publication like the WSJ would ever publish a favorable piece about a community like PUA or TRP the way they did for FDS. I looked. I found a bunch of major publications who dove into why PUA, TRP, and MGTOW are toxic, hateful, and filled with bad advice, but none praising them. This double standard maintained by many redditors and apparently by the writers for major news outlets in condemning TRP-like communities but not their female equivalents is, more than anything, what prompted me to make this post. It also means that if your counterargument is anything like \"well but TRP is toxic!\" it will not change my view on anything, because I agree with that already.  To the meat of why FDS is toxic, hateful, and filled with bad advice:  First it's worth looking at who uses FDS. According to subredditstats.com, r/GenderCritical, reddit's largets TERF subreddit, has a user overlap of 151 with FDS, and is ranked as the most similar sub; r/PinkpillFeminism, arguably reddit's largest and most overt misandristic subreddit, has a user overlap of 482 with FDS, and is also ranked as the most similar subreddit to it. In short, TERFs and misandrists are respectively 151 and 482 times more likely than the average reddit user to frequent FDS; FDS is, therefore, largely populated with transphobes (note it is \"female\" dating strategy, not \"womens\" dating strategy) and man-haters.  As for hatefulness, FDS maintains a host of dehumanizing terms for men, the most popular of which is \"moid,\" meaning a \"man like humanoid,\" meaning, \"something male but not entirely human.\" Another favorite is \"scrote,\" obviously referring to and reducing men down to their testicles, which can be seen in popular FDS flairs like \"The Scrotation,\" or \"Roast-A-Scrote\" or \"Scrotes Mad.\" Finally, \"Low Value Male\" (LVM) and \"High Value Male\" (HVM), which is a way FDS divides up men, not unlike the famous 1-10 scale many women find so degrading, like cattle, into groups that FDS sees as having something to offer them (height, a six pack, a six figure salary, a nice house, nice car, a large penis, etc.) and those who don't; if you lack those things, you are a \"low value\" man, according to FDS.  So lets just stop there for a moment and recap. Imagine there was a male-oriented reddit sub that had nearly a 150x - 500x user overlap with openly misogynistic and transphobic subs. Imagine they routinely referred to women solely as \"non-human female-like creatures,\" or \"vulvas\" or \"holes\" or referred to all women who weren't 120lbs or less with DD breasts and mean blowjob skills and a passion for anal as \"low value.\" Right there I think that would be more than enough to say that this hypothetical sub is toxic and hateful, not deserving of praise.  But FDS is also chalk-full of shitty advice.  * They make fun of men who are passionate about physical fitness (despite demanding men be fit) * \"If we\u2019re not fucking, I don\u2019t want to cuddle. If you\u2019re not taking me out, I don\u2019t want to see you.\" * They unironically support forced vasectomy * They think men who aren't immediately pushing for sex must have weird-looking or \"dysfunctional\" penises * They think that men will always treat women in their present exactly like women in their past and shouldn't be given any amount of time to decide if they want a serious relationship with women * They think that men have nothing to offer except money and attractiveness * They think that small penises aren't \"normal,\" are useless in bed, and women shouldn't be with a man who has one * Men are \"the fucking worst,\" \"trashy, overly sexual, disrespectful ass garbage,\" \"too timid,\" \"intellectually brain dead,\" \"boring,\" \"uncreative and lack curiosity,\" \"unattractive,\" \"shit as sex,\" and \"negligent.\" * They think that men should be \"instantly\" in love with them or they're not worth spending any time on  I could go on but I'm getting tired of linking stuff from there. I think you get the idea.  The final bit of toxicity and bad advice-nature of FDS took me a while to realize. I'm subbed to a lot of subs dealing with gendered and dating issues: GC, PPF, FDS, TRP, MGTOW, etc. As I said earlier, I regard the male versions of these subs as toxic, hateful, and counterproductive, but one (fairly common sense) thing that they get right is that self-improvement is a major prerequisite in regards to having success with women. Advice like \"lose weight, lift, get a sharp hair cut, upgrade your wardrobe, get a high paying job, get a nice car, and develop an interesting and entertaining personality\" is a dime a dozen on PUA and TRP-type subs. And it's not bad advice; if a guy isn't having luck with women, it makes sense to conclude there's probably something about him that needs to be improved so he'll have better chances.  It took me a while to notice, but FDS is totally bereft of any advice of this sort. They are not self-critical or interested in any true self-improvement. Their view on this is that all women are, by virtue of being women, automatically maximally awesome and desirable and deserving of Mr. Right or Prince Charming and the only \"self improvement\" required is that women realize this and stop settling for anything less. You will not find, or at least I haven't in like 6mo of being subbed there and *looking,* any posts telling women to work on their appearance or personality in order to help maximize their chances of success in dating. I would argue that this is both toxic and, in regards to dating, textbook bad advice; if you're repeatedly having bad interactions with the opposite sex the most logical thing to do is to examine the common denominator (and also the only thing you really control in the equation - you - and see what you could do improve yourself. FDS skips that step entirely.  TL;DR: FDS is a toxic, hateful cesspool and a self-reinforcing echo-chamber of bad advice and should be regarded as such, not praised.", "c_root_id_A": "flfdogz", "c_root_id_B": "fleu09a", "created_at_utc_A": 1585103969, "created_at_utc_B": 1585091512, "score_A": 38, "score_B": 19, "human_ref_A": "As a woman who dates women, I can confidently say that if I ever tried using those \"dating strategies\" or that kind of hateful terminology with another woman it would immediately be seen as disgusting toxic behavior.

The WSJ is a newspaper with a conservative editorial page, and as such it tends to publish content that leans conservative. Most of the ways in which FDS is toxic/hateful are just it affirming traditional gender roles: things like being trans-exclusionary, saying that men must pursue women, men must pay for dates, discouraging women from having sex for pleasure alone. These things, while toxic, are all attractive to conservatives because they affirm and support traditional models of gender. And conservatives have never particularly cared about gendered slurs (that's mostly a left-wing thing). So it's not surprising to see an essay supporting this group in a conservative-learning paper like the WSJ.  On the other hand, the male-focused other groups that you mention do not enforce and support gender roles and narratives. Groups like MGTOW are explicit in their rejection of those roles, but other groups like PUA also undermine them in other ways. This makes these groups unattractive to conservative news media, which is why we don't see papers like the WSJ supporting them.  (Both types of groups are of course unpalatable to more liberal media outlets because of the misogyny/transmisogyny.)", "labels": 1, "seconds_difference": 12457.0, "score_ratio": 2.0}

I\u2019ve seen posts talking about covering \u201creal world\u201d skills like taxes and stuff but nothing like this specifically.   There\u2019s a very strong distrust of media and government in society, specifically regarding medical/scientific matters. I can\u2019t say that distrust is unjustified either. You should always try and confirm the validity of what you read or hear. The issue is the average person doesn\u2019t know how to discern what is and isn\u2019t credible. I think the solution is to teach high school students how to read scientific articles.   You might think there\u2019s too much jargon and specific knowledge for someone not in the field to understand. I disagree. When I was in college I took a course called \u201cCommunication in Biology.\u201d It was an alternative for an English gen ed course for bio majors. It obviously focused on biology, but it taught the skills needed to get the gist of the article even in a topic you know nothing about. For example, I could understand the general concepts and credibility of a publication on climate change despite having no formal education on the matter. I may not understand every piece of it, but I can tell if a news article is accurately extrapolating the conclusions of the research article.   To implement this in high schools, this could be done in either science or English courses, or split between both. It would go over the main components of a scientific article: abstract, methods, results, conclusions, and citations. There would be a basic rundown of statistical analysis. Not necessarily how it is calculated (though That would be great to teach in math class) but rather just understanding what p values, CI, standard deviations, etc. measure and how to tell if a value is statistically significant.   Students would be taught how to answer the following questions: -What question did the researchers aim to answer? -what conclusion did they come to? -Does the data actually support that conclusion?  I can currently see two problems with this idea.   1. Finding space for it in curriculum. My solution to this would be for it to be spread out over the span of high school, not all at once. That way nothing large would have to be cut from a single course. It could also be covered partially in both science and English classes since it involves reading comprehension. Stats could be done in math class as well.   2. There is the problem of accessibility of research articles outside an academic setting. Most people won\u2019t have institutional access to scientific journals all their lives and teachers can\u2019t suggest something that\u2019s technically illegal (Scihub). I don\u2019t think it makes it unnecessary to teach, however. It teaches students to think critically about what they\u2019re reading. That applies to all media they read, not just scholarly articles. And hopefully someday we\u2019ll end paywalls on research articles.  This seems like a really good idea that should be implemented so I\u2019m interested in hearing any problems with it that I haven\u2019t considered.

A diagnosis is really only beneficial if you know how to treat or manage that diagnosis. 3. Some diagnosis require medications to help manage. 4. Some mental illnesses share traits or have traits that can be easily confused. 5. Self diagnosis undermines the struggle of people with diagnosed mental health issues to be taken seriously.

Thus, in some circumstances, is important to be an advocate of your own health and know about what may possibly be causing your issues. This can then prevent you from having to pay as many people farther down the line.

I would guess they are deflecting from your questions by attacking you about \u2018hating poor people.\u2019   I do agree there are concerns around self diagnosis. I like the idea of being able to say \u2018here are my symptoms, it seems like ____.\u2019 And then talking to someone about the concerns. That is a healthy approach to self-advocacy.

I believe this understanding coincides with how businesses and the dictionary defines it, but I recognize I could be misinterpreting something.  In this case, by unnecessary I mean that it is almost wholly irrelevant to every situation and conversation I can think of.  The core reason I hold this belief is because any one gender does not inherently allow anyone to safely draw any other conclusions. I have known male-identifying gay friends and acquaintances who will often refer to each-other as she and are more comfortable with those pronouns (or at least, they appear to be;  when I asked there was a lot of good-natured teasing and very little by way of helpful education). This unreliability is, of course, far less prevalent in those that are culturally men and women (I have no idea what the gender version of \"biological male/female\" is), but when non-binary people are thrown into the mix, as I understand it one can't really derive anything specific about how one should treat them based on just that information.  Now, if there is no reliable conclusions to be drawn from gender, does that not make it a little pointless in all conversations not about gender itself? Wouldn't it simply be better to, instead of indicating one's gender on a form, simply leave it at jotting down one's pronouns? Also, since more and more forms seem to ask for gender instead of sex, isn't something being lost there?   As I see it, your landlord doesn't necessarily need to know a nebulous facet of your cultural identity, they need to know what to call you and what kind of hygiene needs you have. I can't think of what benefit knowing your gender would provide to a tinder date, as long as they know what to call you. Meanwhile, even as a bisexual myself, I still thoroughly appreciate knowing what's between someone's legs before a date for preparation purposes.   Even if mentioning one's sex is uncomfortable, wouldn't it be better to just leave the point unaddressed rather than use gender as an unreliable substitute?  If it helps, I'm coming from the perspective of a cisgendered man who has never been very active in LGBT spaces. As such, I fully realize I'm not exactly on the forefront of understanding in this field, and generally keep my opinions to myself.

Say for example the circumstances of the homicide involve a trade secret that, if made public, will financially ruin the defendant (even if the defendant is eventually found not guilty).  If you made it so that the attorney must reveal what happened, then why would any client risk their financial/personal/social status?  Also, the other issue is that it is NOT the attorney's job to determine whether someone is guilty. That is the judge's and/or jury's job. What you're asking is that attorney's decide whether or not someone is guilty of a crime... if so then why even have judges and/or juries in the first place?

Recently when that woman from Apple resigned after saying that 12 white men in a room could be diverse because of their experiences I had a sudden epiphany for what may be wrong with conversations on diversity these days.  To me, the central issue is that our understanding of diversity is only 'observable' diversity.     I've lived and worked in many different cities, especially those with diverse populations such as Singapore, Doha, New York and London.

Don\u2019t give your view any extra logic points because you came up with it.   Onto the point:   When it comes to certian careers it is important that diversity is a thing. This is to get different views and it helps companies watch over themselves. For example, this is important in tv show and movie casting.   Say, you are a casting director for a big movie. The casting notes don\u2019t mention anything about race. Race is not an important feature for this movie. Let\u2019s say you are white.   You will have a (somewhat) natural bias to white people. Because when you read the characters the imaginary person you build in your head will almost always resemble people you know closest. Which is usually yourself and friends and family. This can lean to you choosing a white actor because of the image your thought in your head not because of merit.   This isn\u2019t because the casting director is racist. And this doesn\u2019t mean all white actors are picked because of white casting directors. It is a natural psychlogical thing.   So, a company might want to ensure that black actors aren\u2019t being UNINTENTIONALLY discriminated agaisnt in the hiring process. They want every actor to be screened equally. So they want a black casting director as well to work alongside the white one. This is relevant for marketting, writing, and similar careers to ensure there is no unintentional biases.  With google it is a completly different issue (trust me the issue of women and STEM is never ending).   This is another unintentional thing. Let\u2019s say the boss is a man and the underlings are a mix of men and women. Let\u2019s say the underlings all perform the same. The boss gets told by his boss he needs to promote someone. Who does he promote? Well, in all likeliness, it is going to be a male underling. For much the same reasons as the white casting director.   With Google having a lot of issues with male superiors (and male underlings) devaluing women and not understanding unique problems towards women it is understandable why a woman wouldn\u2019t feel the most comfortable in a room full of 12 men trying to talk about a unique woman issue or talking about unintentional sexism.   Because no one wants to be called racist or sexist. And the casting director and the boss aren\u2019t racists or sexists. They have unintentional biases that it helps to have someone on the other end of that bias to be there to level and question them.   This is all about giving people equal opportunities. We can\u2019t ignore unintentional biases because that restricts the equal opportunities. We should know they happen and think of ways around them.

I think this is not only homophobic but also bad in other ways. First off, it implies that being gay is something bad/shameful/undesirable. The term has generally negative connotations - \"suspect\" means someone is shady, maybe even dangerous. Being suspicious of someone means you don't know if you can trust them, whether they're hiding something or not. In other situations you would be suspicious of an employee that you think is stealing from your business, or of your partner that you think might be cheating. Accusing someone of being \"sus\" in the viral game Among Us means you think that person is the \"bad guy\"/murderer. So by saying that someone is \"sus\" for \"acting gay\", it implies being gay is something negative.  Then there is also the part of it that's reinforcing toxic stereotypes. For example if two of your male friends hug each other and you say \"yo that was a bit sus\" as a joke then it reinforces the idea that men should not show emotions or affection.

With this is mind, this is why I believe that Ethics/Philosophy type courses should be as consistently available in high schools as in other electives: They offer a way of understanding the world in a time where the mind is still developing and beginning to struggle with existential questions, and also allow for students to make better decisions in their lives.   When comparing these types of courses to others, such as music, art, or physical education, it is clear that many of these don't have much immediate practical value. I would actually say that the ability to gain a more broad worldview and at least a basic formation of some sort of internal moral code could be more valuable in the present day than being able to run quickly, although there are benefits to both. In many instances, having such an exposure would be of large benefit to people.  In terms of practicality, I think that designing a course tailored for high school students is challenging, but not impossibly difficult. Books tailored for teenagers have been written in this genre (Sophie's World comes to mind), and connections can be drawn from text/concepts to the real world. Finding teachers to teach such a subject competently probably wouldn't be hard, either. Many teachers in the general 'humanities' field have some background in this, and I would guess that a decent number of them would be interested and willing to share this interest with others. Compared to other electives, which may require money for instruments, or art supplies or similar things, it's not really that expensive, either.  One danger is that this kind of course can be taught poorly, and that some of the effectiveness of it may be lost on students. However, we take this risk with subjects such as math all the time, with students oftentimes turned away because of a teacher that is unable to clearly explain subjects. Even if the precedents in this are ignored, I think that simple exposure, even if incomplete, will still bring more benefits than harm.     _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

Algebra laid down a few foundational concepts in logic, and geometry cemented a lot of those concepts with formal proofs and analogies to how \"real world\" logic works. Then in the post- geometry math courses, we used algebraic proofs to establish how different relationships arise between numbers and formulas. The point of this coursework was to establish the foundations for higher level math, but for those of us who didn't go much further in math, it laid down a lot of foundational skills in logic and reasoning (and by extension, common fallacies and mistakes in reasoning).  Contemporaneously with that math education, our science education started relying more on math (and the attendant logical problem solving skills). How do we tie together the known formulas and definitions to figure out the unknowns starts teaching the use of logic as a \"toolbox\" for solving problems. I also took a programming class in high school, which relied heavily on an assumption that we had strong logic skills.  Then, the rhetoric and persuasion type courses start building up practice in practical use of logic in non-technical disciplines. Literature coursework starts exploring a lot of philosophical concepts, especially ethics, truth, fairness, etc. Reading works from different religious traditions really started to demonstrate the importance of certain philosophical underpinnings in different cultures. We get to thinking about these things before even taking a formal philosophy course.   By the time I took a formal philosophy course, I realized that it was just a condensed, focused version of things I had already learned in high school. I ended up majoring in philosophy, but I think that my high school education was already pretty strong in philosophy, at least as much as one could expect for students of high school age and experience. In fact, one of the most notoriously difficult sophomore courses in my major, symbolic logic, was made easier from my high school math experience.  So adding a dedicated philosophy course at the high school level wouldn't add much, in my opinion. We should bolster the \"core\" classes to highlight philosophical concepts, sure, but the best high school curricula already expose students to a solid philosophical education.", "human_ref_B": ">With this is mind, this is why I believe that Ethics/Philosophy type courses should be as consistently available in high schools as in other electives: They offer a way of understanding the world in a time where the mind is still developing and beginning to struggle with existential questions, and also allow for students to make better decisions in their lives.

It's important to remember that analytical/critical thinking skills are developed over time.  By 8th grade we're conditioned to believe that the text is the undisputed truth and learn the material accordingly, in high school that trend mostly continues but now we're introduced to the idea of perspective.

CMV To start of, I realize how difficult of an issue this is. Banning alcohol flat-out would only cause problems and probably more than I know of, but my opinion is that the 'culture' we have built around alcohol in western society (I'm Western European, if anyone's interested) is very toxic to our every day life and especially children growing up.   My background preceding this view is, I think, important. So I'll start of with that. I grew up in a small village where alcohol and straight alcoholism is not treated as much of a big deal. In fact, people fail to recognize alcholism and problem-drinkers so extremely much that my own mother has grown up into extreme alcoholism without ever getting the help she has been needing for over at least 40 years. It has affected both herself and those close to her, including me. She has recently confessed to me that her problem had been going on for this long and that the people around her in her youth (my guess would be early 20's) thought her attitude towards alcohol was cool.   This is not rare. Especially villages have the risk of getting into extreme alcoholism and though I know I live in one of the worst places when it come to this issue (I have actually looked at statistics), I think it does highlight in a hyperbolic way how toxic the culture we live in can be to many people. Having grown up with an alcoholic has made me very sensitive to the signs of alcoholism and I recognize it a lot easier than most. My offers of help would be dismissed and ridiculed.  People who don't drink are called 'straight-edge', but not in a good way. I have made my own conscious decision to not drink, because doing so would be triggering to me. I couldn't hang around people who drink or casually go to a party without it being forced on me. I have had people get legitimately angry at me for not drinking. I 'spoil the fun', I'm prude and I'm boring. I am apparently not allowed to have fun without getting drunk.  I think every one of you at least knows someone who has a problem with alcohol and maybe even had it themselves. In how many of those cases did these people have to get into an accident, have to go through something horrible before they would get help?  In my opinion, the way we glorify alcohol in the media contributes to how hard it is for these people to get help. Commercials for alcohol are full of objectification of women and machismo. They target people who naively buy into the image of the charming man who is succesful with women. Drinking away problems is almost encouraged in some cases. I am not completely against any positive portrayal of alcohol, but I think there's a great lack of nuance.  Having said all that, I am still open to opposing views and hope to see if anyone has any information I'm missing that might get me to change my view.", "c_root_id_A": "cbgsya7", "c_root_id_B": "cbgp3g7", "created_at_utc_A": 1375639055, "created_at_utc_B": 1375624762, "score_A": 33, "score_B": 31, "human_ref_A": "Having worked in the substance abuse prevention field with remote villages in the past, I'd say that the bigger problem is village life, not alcohol glorification. I think you're focusing your efforts in the wrong place. Not so long ago, villages needed everyone to contribute in order for the village to survive. Now, that's not the case and there's nothing for most people to do. I've been to places where anything in an aerosol can had to be kept behind the counter at the store and not sold to minors because kids were so desperate for an escape that they'd huff whatever they could get their hands on. Alcohol is just another escape, just like any other drug.   You're never going to be able to change how alcohol is portrayed in popular culture, so you need to counteract it with messages that it isn't necessary or good for you. More importantly, though, you need to find something for people to do so they don't feel the need to turn to substance use in the first place.", "human_ref_B": "There is a reason alcohol is glorified, it is incredibly fun. Alcohol is the only legal drug that gives people any sort of altered state. Think about this for a second; the easiest way people can feel anything but a sober state of consciousness without breaking the law, is consuming alcohol... which is a ridiculous expectation to put on an animal that has been altering its state of consciousness for almost the entirety of our existence through a variety of different drugs, all of which are now illegal to consume. It is inherent for some people.  Alcohol is the last of the legal drug; this fact alone is enough to encourage substance abuse.  Also, the major problem with your argument is it revolves entirely around problem drinkers, which is an incredibly shallow way to form a balanced opinion. For anything there is a group of people that will not mix well with whatever this is. This includes, but is not limited to: alcohol, cheeseburgers, children, guns, cars and credit cards - for every one of those magnificent things there is a fairly sizable chunk of people who just for some reason or another cannot deal with it; so we have alcoholics, obesity, domestic abusers, murderers, felons and economy crashers. Shit.  But there are also a huge majority who *can* be responsible with whatever it is, and those people get great pleasure out of it in return. So we allow the good with the bad, after all there is unquestionably more good in those cases. This is great news, because we want to have as many choices as we can so we can feel like a 'free' human. We like choices, it makes us feel like we are in charge of our own lives.  Drinking is one of these choices, and for a lot of us (myself included) we can binge drink without it affecting our lives in a negative way. For some, it is incredibly fun and all sorts of different people experience different results with it. It gives the little man in your head a break from the controls for a while, and in steps his ugly cousin Boris who has only stumps where his fingers should be and he just starts hammering buttons; he has more confidence, wants to party, wants to dance to shit music, more outgoing, wants to go pick up, wants to crank the dial, wants to go on stage, wants to be the centre of attention, and just be in the company of friends while on the same wild fucked up journey.  So yes, when people say to you 'it spoils the fun' that you don't drink, they actually feel that way - I can sometimes feel that way. Don't get me wrong, I can have a good time with sober people while sober, and I have an excellent time with drunk people while drunk. If I am sober, drunk people can annoy me, and if I am drunk sober people annoy me. The two states just do not mix that well. So when you come along to whatever the event is and everyone is drinking but you, it takes the tone of the event down, like a herd that moves only as fast as the slowest buffalo. This peer pressure isn't just to make you drink the poisonous fire water, this is to try and get you on the same journey as everyone else so you can experience the same altered state together. Sober people and drunk people simply cannot experience the same thing.

I have worked with such people all over the place. They routinely put in 9-10 hour days when they are only required to work 8. From what I can tell, generally it is not anything pressing. There is no imminent deadline. They simply choose to continue working when they could easily continue the work tomorrow (which they generally always need to do anyway).  Above all else, it's a matter of getting the most out of your life. 90% of people are not happy with their jobs, so it's highly unlikely that anyone who is presently at work is enjoying their life more than they would be if they were not at work.  Simply put, there is no legal requirement for you to work beyond this. An employer cannot force you to stay at work beyond 40 hours as a salaried employee. Are there fires to fight sometimes? Sure! Please do note that I'm accounting for this, that sometimes you do need to stay late. But in my experience, the people who stay late often aren't doing it because of all the crises they are fighting; they are simply choosing to stay at work longer.  If you have a job where you ARE constantly fighting fires and having to stay late, then the smart thing to do would be to get a new job, one that actually allows you to go home at time. Those jobs exist. Don't lie to yourself and say they don't.  Why can't you walk out the door at quitting time? Why can't that task wait until tomorrow? Your company hired you to work 40 hours a week. This is why, when you're sick, you are deducted 8 hours, not 9 or 10. They can't tell you you HAVE to stay late, and if they DO, then get the hell out of that job.  Honestly, the employees I see that routinely stay late are, in fact, very INefficient workers. A great example of when I had to stay late recently was a meeting scheduled for 60 minutes, yet it went for 90, and all we did was review and discuss 5 slides of data. 5. But the people in this meeting took incredibly circuitous routes in making their points and simply could not summarize their thoughts or get beyond the \"analysis paralysis\". And because of this I got to watch one fewer episode of Modern Family which I love dearly.  The only legit reason I can think of to stay late is if you want more money or want promotions and what not. But I reject the notion that money will make you happy, and if that happiness comes at the expense of actually having the time to spend it, then what's the point? Working hard at a job you don't like to make more money is like trying to get yourself comfy on a tight airplane seat vs. lying down on a cushy sofa. There's a clear winner here.  To sum up: HAVE to stay late too much? Get a new job. Insist that your work really does take you 9-10 hours? Get more efficient.

So the prevailing wisdom is: as an average person, the best thing you can do to protect and grow your wealth is to invest your money in broad market ETFs or mutual funds.  The basic concept is, when you invest in a company, you are buying a piece of that company, and as the company grows and becomes more valuable, the value of your share raises as well.  On the small scale, this concept makes a lot of sense.  For instance, let's say me and a couple friends buy a bakery down the street.  We each own a 30% share in the bakery, and enjoy a 30% share of the profits each month.  When decisions have to be made about the operation of the bakery, the three of us sit down together and have the authority to make a decision.  And probably I can grab a free piece of freshly baked bread whenever I decided to stop by.  But let's say I spend $2k on a share of Google stock.  In which practical way does my \"ownership\" of this portion of the company affect my relationship with Google?  I don't get any privileged access to the data they're collecting.  I don't get priority treatment if I have to contact customer service.    In terms of my relationship with a company, for the average investor the sum total of your involvement with the company is that you get to vote on certain company decisions, where you have basically zero real influence because large interests controlling large portions of the stock have a million more votes than you.  You *might* get a dividend payment, depending on the stock.  But for example, with a company like AAPL, even if they gave a super high dividend of $1 per quarter, it would take like 34 years for one share of AAPL stock to pay for itself.  Your \"investment\" is also not really investing, in the sense of giving a company additional capital with which to grow and improve their business, since you're just buying the share off some other person, and none of that money is going back to the company.  So for all intents and purposes, the only real tangible value of owning a stock for the average person is the promise that it will be worth more to someone else in the future.  So basically, from a logical point of view, there is no real practical difference between a stock or any purely speculative asset, like an NFT or cryptocurrency token or a rare Pok\u00e9mon card.  It's just a piece of paper with a company's name on it, which cannot be meaningfully exchanged for any goods, services or utility.  It's just a piece of paper which hopefully will be worth more in the future.  And this kind of works fine, because assuming that the economy is generally growing over time, which it always has, and assuming everyone keeps buying into it, there will essentially always be a \"greater fool\" in the future who will want that piece of paper, to in turn sell it to an even greater fool down the line.  So it seems to me we've chosen this as a back-handed way of dealing with taking care of retiring people: we tell young working people they have to buy the shares from the old people, so those old people can go off and buy a condo in Florida.  And in turn those young working people trust their stocks are going to be worth something to the young people after them.  So to sum it all up, my view is that the whole stock market, as far as it functions for the average investor, is basically a scheme in which the main function is to transfer money from new investors to old investors, and it's only made sustainable by a steady influx of new investors, much like a Ponzi scheme or any speculative asset bubble.  The only real difference is that society kind of all agreed on the S&P 500 as the socially acceptable Ponzi, so it's kind of works for the most part.

Absent of any other option an investor who needs the liquidity may instead be forced to liquidate the company assets.  As a whole you're half right, there is the base value of a company which can clearly be seen with your bakery example, where it's value would usually be based on it's physical assets and overall financial health & profitability, then there's the speculative side which bumps up the value of the stock by trends often attached to the popularity of the company/brand, which is kind of unavoidable.  However this concept would also be true for any physical goods like speculation on commodities, etc... so unless you also consider buying actual commodities a \"ponzi\" due to their susceptibility to market speculation above their value as a utility, I don't think it's necessarily fair to single out the stock market as a \"ponzi\".", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 278.0, "score_ratio": 2.75}

{"post_id": "68l3y1", "domain": "changemyview_test", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "history": "CMV: Universal basic income will, in the long term, entrench inequality When the  subject of a universal basic income (UBI) comes up, people often give the same arguments: it will reduce poverty; it will make welfare more efficient by simplifying administration; and it will make labour fairer by providing an alternative to either starving or getting trapped in a cycle of low-paid exploitative jobs.  Critics tend to say that UBI will make people lazy by removing the incentive to work, that it's useless because companies will simply pass on any loss in profits to consumers, or that the money just doesn't exist for it.  Personally, I think that UBI would probably be fairly effective at accomplishing its aims, and that while it might disrupt our society significantly we would adapt. I think the resulting society might even be better for the poorest. Feel free to challenge this, but it's not really my main argument.  I'm concerned that if UBI is implemented, it would, in the long term, entrench inequality. Here are my assumptions:  1. The biggest inequality is between those that earn money through capital and those that earn money by wages. The majority of people will never earn enough money through a salary to rival those who own lots of capital. UBI wouldn't change this, because the gap to be closed is orders of magnitude too large. 3. UBI would, presumably, be largely paid for by the rich, but won't be so damaging to accumulated wealth that the inequality between labour and capital reduces significantly. If UBI cost enough to do this, I don't see how it could be sustainable once those fortunes are exhausted. At that point, society would be forcibly redistributing capital, which is a lot further than most people are willing to go. 2. Income from UBI would largely be spent on the same things most people's salary already goes towards: rent (or a mortgage), food, and so on. Either UBI makes a big difference to a person, in which case it will likely go towards essentials, or it's just an extra supplement on top of a satisfactory salary---nice to have, but not going to make a person rich.  So inequality remains, albeit hopefully with the reduction or disappearance of abject poverty. The rich continue to get richer because people still need to pay them for food and rent and so on, and the poor are slightly less poor.

{"post_id": "upvkbr", "domain": "changemyview_test", "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "history": "CMV: Spectators of a livestream who join with intent to watch massacre should be prosecuted I have a view that I feel in the wake of the shooting that I think makes sense, but am willing to have my mind changed. I read somewhere that the shooter was scoping his targets for up to twenty minutes before finally shooting, with at least 20 spectators in the livestream. I don't know if this is true and the CMV does not deal with the facts of this particular massacre, rather it deals with the general case where an illegal act is livestreamed with actual spectators in the platform  I believe the following:   Assuming there were spectators to a livestream that recorded illegal acts like mass shootings or lynchings:  1. Law enforcement should be empowered to subpoena the website hosting the livestream to compel the website/platform to provide data relating to the livestream (IP Addresses, date of the livestream and any other identifying information about the author of the livestream ***as well as the spectators***) 2. There should be a **severe** legal penalty if it can be proven, as a result of this subpoena, for people who watched a livestream with full knowledge of what was to transpire who did not a good faith attempt to inform law enforcement (where someone's digital footprint demonstrates that they knew of the plans of the attack, encouraged it and did not act upon that information). 3. I do not know if there is a law that deals specifically with spectators. If there is such a law, I believe that that law should be modified to further increase the penalties whatever those penalties currently are  For the purpose of this CMV, I am defining spectator as those who *(1) watch a livestream of an illegal act, such as a massacre or assault, (2) who had prior knowledge that such an act would be committed and (3) made no good faith attempt to contact law enforcement.*   I tried Googling about the legalities of watching \"illegal livestreams\" but all I got were articles about watching illegally obtained copyright materials. The only article I could find was this which deals specifically with California, citing failure to report a crime as a misdemeanor. This is ***INADEQUATE*** and **my CMV calls for something more punitive and expansive such as a federal statute with penalties requiring more than 10 years incarceration and penalties much higher than $1000.**  I am willing to have my view changed and considered the following counterpoints:   **Privacy**  However, I think if we were to transpose the digital situation into a real life situation, I think people who were physically present who went out of there way to watch an illegal commission of an act with knowledge beforehand that the act was going to transpire, I think law enforcement is empowered to prosecute those spectators. Similarly, if an IP Address or other digital foot print can be linked to a person who entered a livestream with the intent to an illegal act, they should be similarly prosecuted.  This would require that companies provide more information about the user: their login and chat history. But I feel that punishing those who watch massacres as entertainment would be a net benefit for society. And the subpoena power would be scoped to just that livestream and the information of the users who view that livestream.  **Is it reasonable to expect platforms to provide this information?**  I think it is. Platforms should provide whatever they have. My CMV does not compel platforms to acquire information about users: just that they provide whatever they have upon receiving a subpoena which is again scoped to that specific livestream and the relevant meta data of the users.  Even if it were the case that most of the spectators use technologies or methods to obfuscate their identity or digital footprint, I still think it would be a social good to compel platforms to provide whatever they have about the spectators of the livestream. Hopefully at least one or a few spectators can be punished. Shaming the few we can catch will be a net good for society and hopefully their pathology can be better understood.   **If you don't know what the penalties are, why increase them?**  I think increasing the penalties (if they don't exist for spectators of these livestreams) should be increased to send a message. People who view these livestreams need to be made an example of to break the sick dynamic where murderers perform their illegal acts for posterity or for status\u2014any community that has a member who makes a credible threat of violence should understand that if the act were to transpire, law enforcement, the media and the American people will descend upon them and find perpetrators and abettors to crimes.   I would be willing to change my mind on this specific point if 1. there is already a law addressing spectators AND the law is so punitive that a convincing case can be made that increasing the penalties will do little to deter the act itself or the desire to watch it unfold.   **How punitive is too punitive? Your calls for punishment is not proportional to the act which is merely spectating a crime**  I think in light of the social dynamics of these massacres, we need to rethink the seriousness of \"just spectating\" a livestream of a massacre (again, with full knowledge that a massacre is or is about to unfold). Misdemeanor levels of punishment is inadequate. We have specific laws for educators and professionals who are mandated reports\u2014similarly, in a digital, distributed world, it is fair to empower all citizens to be mandated reporters of heinous crimes within their communities and platforms. Most will not report\u2014my CMV calls for empowering law enforcement and our statutes to forcibly compel platforms to provide metadata and punish spectators as well as the perpetrator. Increasing the punishment will provide a net beneficial value to society by letting users know that by even watching a massacre, law enforcement will have the legal tools to find and identify you.   **Would your view include those who did make a good faith attempt but for whatever reason cannot provide evidence that they made an attempt to contact law enforcement?**  This is one of the more difficult parts of my view. I think those people should not be prosecuted. But even if my view results in very few cases where people can be convicted, I think it is a good standard to set on principle\u2014if the various elements of a spectator with prior knowledge and further evidence that no good faith attempt was made, we need to increase those penalties, even if it is very hard to prove all of these facts.  Again, these are just my initial feelings upon hearing the news today about Buffalo. A small part of me feels that my view may be ill considered in the long term but I would like to understand why.

It costs way more to house a prisoner per year than the average American pays in taxes, and that's not even counting the indirect losses in terms of lost workers from the labor force.  Frivolous incarceration often increases crime. You take an edgy teen and throw them in prison for 10 years and give them a criminal record. You have both destroyed their employability and also ensured that their closest acquaintances are now all hardened felons, making them much more likely to turn to crime upon release.  And perhaps most importantly, harsh sentences do little if anything to deter crime. Criminals respond much more strongly to *likelihood* of being apprehended, which you can increase through more robust policing, but they are surprisingly unconcerned with the size of the penalty. Except it's actually not all that surprising on closer inspection because anyone who thought there was a realistic likelihood of being caught wouldn't commit the crime to begin with. Humans are terrible at precisely calculating the exact size of tail-end risks with severe ramifications, like 1% chance of a stiff sentence.

That said, I do acknowledge the argument in favor of it, especially in this context.  The video game piracy debate is nothing new, and a cursory glance at this sub will tell you that there are those who fall on both sides of the spectrum on this topic. It's not my intention to delve too deeply into the morality of video game piracy with this post, but rather to address accountability of the companies producing the games.  To expand on the title, a sizeable amount of video game piracy centers around games which are, for one reason or another, not readily available to the mass market. These generally tend to include games which saw a physical release long enough ago that they are no longer available through primary distribution. If you didn't have the opportunity to purchase one of these games during that release window then there are essentially two options available if you wish to play it: Either purchase the game secondhand, or pirate it. Obviously one of these is the more morally questionable choice, but the common thread between the two is that either way, no money is going to the game developers at this point.  Now for where the main issues come into play. Obviously game companies want to protect their IPs, so when piracy sites begin sharing those games for free, the best course of action seems like it would be to take them down. However, in many cases this has the additional effect of cutting off access for new players to experience these games.  A great example I want to ~~pick on~~ focus on is Nintendo, a company that is notorious for issuing DMCA takedown notices when piracy websites come into play. At the same time, however, for the majority of the affected titles Nintendo has refused to provide a legal, accessible, and most importantly *primary* source to purchase them. Don't get me wrong, things like used game stores are great, but a lot of places, particularly countries that never saw a formal release of those games, have limited access to and supply of them. In addition their copies of games tend to be a bit worse for wear, with no quality guarantee, plus the game company doesn't profit off of them, which...isn't that a big part of why they come down on piracy sites? Because someone else is profiting off of their IP? I dunno, that last bit went on a bit of a tangent.  I will acknowledge the good that releasing products like the NES and SNES Classic did, plus the access we have to classic games through Nintendo Switch Online, but the currently available 72 NES games and 42 SNES games are just a drop in the bucket compared to the **1433** games that were produced between them. That's a mere **8%** of a massive game library available in modern format, and those are just the first two consoles. The Game Boy Advance, Nintendo's third highest selling console of all time, handheld or otherwise, is historically the most popular category for video game piracy websites. The console boasts a library of 1498 games, and 74 of these games are currently available for purchase via Nintendo Virtual Console (which at the time of making this post is the only first party way I am aware of to obtain a majority of GBA games), giving us an even more pathetic 5% of availability. The best part? When comparing this list of available games to the top 40 best-selling GBA games of all time, how many do you think made the cut? Surely Nintendo would at least want to capitalize on the popularity of one of their best selling handheld consoles, right? Well that number comes to...16 games. So not only did we get laughable representation of the library, but barely a fifth of this number represent the games players are most likely to seek out, enjoy, and most importantly in this argument's case, pirate.  Numbers, percentages and Nintendo-shaming aside, what am I getting at here? While piracy sites show there is clearly a demand for these older games, many game developers seem to stubbornly deny a way for players to gain access to them. That or the way they go about it is temporary and convoluted (Looking at you 3D All-Stars.) If a video game company is going to cut off the only access many younger users have to these games, legal or otherwise, the absolute, most basic courtesy they could show would be to make them available in a modern format.

Depending on your voting system, this will either be a FPTP system (highest individual total wins), or some form of run-off where the least popular candidate is struck and then secondary choices of his voters are applied, then the process repeats until someone has a majority (above 50%).  This means that there is no way to sensibly split the results without creating government bloat. In order for people's votes to \"not be wasted\", you would effectively need every office to have a committee of 3-5 (or more) equally-ranked people, filled proportional to the votes cast. This would not make society better - it would simply waste tax money and see that nothing is ever accomplished.  Moreover, any politician or elected official who isn't utterly stupid will pay attention to the elections that got them into power.

Rape is a very hard charge to prove, as most cases come down to \"he said, she said\". This is why externalities - such as dress, behavior, etc. - are used to help determine who is telling the truth. These have been attacked in recent years, because they inherently remove agency from a woman - as in, wearing tight clothing does not mean that the woman wants to have sex, and it especially does not mean that she doesn't have the right to change her mind about sex between when she puts it on and when the two individuals are alone.   Yes, false rape allegations happen. The rate at which they happen is rather disputed, because it is difficult to distinguish between a false charge and a true charge where we don't have sufficient evidence to convict. Remember, convictions require evidence \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" and in many situations a jury can reasonably doubt that the sex was not consensual.   So knowing that, imagine that you are a woman who has been raped, perhaps by an acquaintance or a spouse, with no witnesses or evidence to show that it was not consensual.

While I agree that not all woman have vaginas and not all people with vaginas are women I don't think it is fair to tell someone that what makes them personally feel like a woman is false. Every woman has different things that make them connect with the idea of being a woman (some are choices and some aren't).

I don't think there is anything wrong with a woman feeling like her pussy or the fact that she can give birth is part of what makes her feel connected to the word woman as long as she recognizes that not all women have vaginas or the ability to give birth and they are still just as much of a woman as she is.

It is impossible to connect all women with a single trait other than their shared identity of describing themselves as women. Why can't having a vagina, which is a trait shared by 99% of women, be an acceptable thing to connect with other women about?   The female reproductive system is treated unfairly by the government. Saying that doesn't mean I don't agree that healthcare for trans women (and men) is also unjust. This backlash feels like their saying \"the injustices of my group are worse than yours therefore your injustices shouldn't be fought for.\"  I think it is important for feminism to be intersectional, I just also think is is ok to accept that everyone identifies the way they do for their own specific and personal reasons. Doing so doesn't mean they don't accept you for having your own different or even contradictory personal reasons for sharing that label.

And then I come along, and I just don't like the taste of Cheerios. Because the association between Cheerios and manhood is so widespread, people will also assume the opposite: if you *don't* eat Cheerios, you are not a real man.  In your example, if an individual woman is just saying that as a simply personal statement, then you're correct. She can experience a sense of belonging to her gender because of her sex. I don't think feeling that way is wrong, it actually seems pretty rational to me. And it doesn't necessarily imply that she also thinks \"Not having a vagina is not feminine\". But when an overwhelming portion of a modern society feels a certain way, that feeling / belief system becomes part of society, and creates exclusion of people who do not feel that same way. It becomes a truth in society.  A woman who thinks this way is implicitly saying that her gender (\"I feel like a woman\") is directly tied to her biological sex (\"I have a vagina / female sex organs\"), which is objectively trans-exclusive, *especially* because that usually means \"If I didn't have a vagina, I would feel like less of a woman,\" and *especially* when it is the majority view.

As far as I understand it, veganism as a lifestyle (not just as a diet) is about reducing harm to and not participating in the exploitation of animals. Obviously everyone has their own way of living a vegan life and veganism means something different to everyone, but in my opinion, there are certain ethical ways to use resources from animals.  * EGGS    * Hens lay eggs whether they're fertilized or not, so if someone owned a hen or two and ate the eggs that they were going to lay anyway, they are just making sure that those eggs aren't going to waste. This is different from buying eggs from a company that practices factory farming and has chickens for the sole purpose of profit, which would not be ethical. * HONEY    * Similarly, bees make honey whether or not anyone is there to harvest it, and they make more than they could possibly ever use. Taking the excess is, as I understand it, actually beneficial to the bees. In addition, beekeeping can be seen as a form of conservation, as bees are endangered, which I think is ethical. * WOOL    * Domesticated sheep need to be sheared regularly.

Difficult animals - ornery.  The sheep are indeed in need of sheering, but only because we've enslaved them for so long and bred them.

We exploit the environment for our benefit all the time.  The bees do to, so do the sheep.

If Eminem died after *The Marshall Mathers LP* or *The Eminem Show* he would be definitively considered the GOAT. If Kanye died after *Graduation* or *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* he would be considered the GOAT.  Alternatively, If Nas and Jay-Z both died during their famous rap feud, they would be elevated similar to Pac and Big. Same could be said for 50 and Ja Rule.  I could go on all day, but my point is that because these artists kept putting out music (some of which has been considered lackluster), they damaged their reputation as the GOAT in a way Tupac and Big never really had a chance to do. Arguably, Tupac came close to damaging his reputation with all his posthumous releases, but, more people would need to know about his posthumous releases for it to have a significant impact.

I'm trying to gauge how representative my experience of how quantitative methods are generally viewed by traditional humanities scholars is.  Basically, it seems like there is a general distaste for quantitative methods, stemming from a few sources.   First, quantitative methods are aligned with capitalism, patriarchy, and are overhyped by zelous quants who are mostly men. I can understand an association between power and quantification - it's very useful on many levels, so it's not surprising that those in power use it. But I don't see that as a barrier to using quantification for other goals and interests. In other words, an association between quantification and power is an accident of history, not something essential to quantification itself.  Second, quantitative methods have limited applicability to humanistic goals and questions. I agree it has limits. But I feel like I encounter assertions about these limits that don't make sense. Like someone saying \"I don't know how to measure fear\" ignoring the immense amount of cognitive science on measurement and conceptualization of affect. Or, statements that quantitative methods can't be intersectional because they must treat variables (like race and sexual orientation) as independent - which is just plain wrong. It's trivial to run two models with y = f(x) + f(z) and y = f(x, z) and test which model is better.   Or, legitimate limitations of a quantitative method are treated as insurmountable. Examples I've seen include peopling acting as if time series analysis doesn't exist, mixed-models don't exist, or non-linear models don't exist. Basically outright ignorance of how flexible modern statistical methods are leads to a fatalistic attitude towards the capabilities of quantitative methods.  Likewise, quantitative researchers are believed to be less thoughtful about their methods than they really are. Basically ignoring how much scientists think deeply about underlying issues in interpreting and presenting data, and never acknowledging perspectives like this: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/gelman_hennig_full_discussion.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwi8gIy-hN_gAhVFYKwKHVyRAt0QFjAAegQICBAB&usg=AOvVaw3Oe2f-yaRLIEQ-LI0s4sof   Now, I know there are plenty of dudebros who wield the word \"objectivity\" like a verbal cudgel in debates - but these guys are your average internet commenter, and don't represent the depth to which my quant colleagues understand their methods.

But in a clickbait and headline driven world, most people don't bother. A lie can get around the world before the truth has time to put on it's pants.  A truly effective quantitative model would be amazing, but human limits make them impossible. The world is outrageously complex, and trying to derive reproducible truth out of simplified models is an overwhelming challange. It's like in the show CSI where they used to say \"enhance\" and increase the resolution of low definition security camera tapes. That's impossible in real life. If you use a simple model, you can't extrapolate it to real life.   The only reason why they work in the hard sciences is because physics is a lot less complicated than the humanities. For example, the speed of light in a vacuum is the same everywhere in the universe. Meanwhile, two identical twins sitting next to each other watching the same movie at the same time might have completely different thoughts floating around in their heads.  The standard to convince scholars to take quantitative analysis in the social sciences seriously is pretty low. To alleviate skepticism, take a quantitative model and use it to make predictions that come true. Math and physics can do that. Show that you get reproducible results. All hard sciences can do that.  It doesn't need to be causation. Correlation works too, and is often used in the medical sciences. But quantitative reserach in the humanities needs to meet the same standard that quantitative reserach has to meet in any other field.  As a final point, don't mix up bias against quantitative analysis in the humanities with bias on the part of academics in the humanities.

It also is typically seen as an artistic, self-expressive act by the creator.  \\- The work provokes an emotional, meaningful, or thought provoking response in those engaging with it.  \\- It has a lasting cultural effect or meaningful impact on society.  \\- It is, well... creating something that wasn't there before! Someone making ***anything*** that expresses their inner world, to me, is inherently more artistic than a video of you doing squats at the gym.  It's obvious to see that these platforms function in an inherently different way than all other creative or artistic platforms in human history, and thus effect the artistic works made for the platforms. All social media websites are driven on user engagement, with the algorithms that drive these websites solely focused on ***keeping users on their platform as long as possible.*** This by itself is going to change the nature of the media made for these platforms - users are no longer rewarded for creating works that have higher ***quality,*** or have a thought provoking or lasting effect on society, they are only rewarded for creating works that are immediately eye catching, or keep users engaged for this exact moment, only to be forgotten about seconds later quite often. Obviously this feedback loop will lead to people who shape their lives around creating content for these platforms, and will make works that lead to user engagement.   Does this change in mentality, the change to a \"Content Creator\" lead to less artistically valuable works being made on the whole? I think, in general, it does. Many platforms incentivize creators to constantly be pushing out new content, and I think this is antithetical to the quiet contemplation many artistic works require. I think many people who might have opted to be an author before YouTube became huge might choose now to make a film analysis channel, or something similar, due to the instant feedback and ability to reach more people, as opposed to spending months or years doing research and writing a novel alone. There are more people opting into a less artistic platform, and making less quality creations as a result. There is also much less of a focus on originality and/or artistry, and more of a focus on entertainment  Things to address about my argument and things that will change my view:  \\- I hope this isn't coming off as pretentious - I don't think these platforms are bad for ***society*** or anything like that, they are just bad for ***artistic creation!***  \\- If you can prove that on the whole, there are more quality creative works being made now than there were previously. I mean heck, maybe only 3% of all YouTube channels are actually of artistic quality, but maybe that's more than there used to be during the hayday of Television, Radio and film. (Please link your artistically pleasing sources here!)  \\- If you can change my mind on what criteria is important when determining artistic value - I'm open to having my view changed on this, have fun with it!  \\- If you can show me other platforms or other avenues that creators are disseminating their original artistic works, and are incentivized on originality. Bandcamp is a good example.  \\- If you can argue that in the future, it won't always be this way, and that while at the moment this is the effect that algorithms are having on content creation, that for some reason it will actually have a ***positive*** impact on artistic value, eventually.", "c_root_id_A": "hqpryg7", "c_root_id_B": "hqpuuo0", "created_at_utc_A": 1640978105, "created_at_utc_B": 1640979301, "score_A": 20, "score_B": 124, "human_ref_A": "Content creation on intentionally broad, because it doesn't have to be art.

Growing up I always thought America was the coolest and wanted to live there (based on American music, TV, movies, etc.) however now I\u2019m older my view has changed a lot and this is no longer the case.  My stance is purely comparing America to my home country (Scotland).  I now believe America is capitalism gone wild, which is great if you\u2019re rich and successful already, but if you\u2019re not it\u2019s a rigged system you\u2019re unlikely to beat.  In Scotland I have free education and free healthcare - 2 things I believe are essential to a true land of the free.

Furthermore, in America not only is healthcare not free, but it\u2019s so privatised doctors have ulterior motives in recommending treatment as they have deals to use certain medications, which means their recommendations cannot be viewed as unbiased.  I believe this is, in part, what lead to the opioid crisis America is currently in.  Similarly, your prisons are privatised which means they don\u2019t have a vested interest in reforming you, but rather in keeping you behind bars to make as much profit as possible.  Regardless of my stance on guns I believe that the presumption that people could have guns makes your police more jittery leading to unnecessary shootings, which obviously are non existent here, and our police are generally viewed as civil servants, not soldiers.  Obviously America is a world super power and leads the way in a lot of things, but I believe as a random person of average health, average intelligence, and average income, if you were plucked out the air and dropped in either America or Scotland you\u2019d have a much better chance of \u201cfreedom\u201d (in terms of actual freedoms such as freedom from debt, freedom from incarceration, freedom to get educated, freedom to be healthy, etc.) in Scotland (or other similar western first world nations) than America.", "c_root_id_A": "g4odqux", "c_root_id_B": "g4o9z21", "created_at_utc_A": 1599745310, "created_at_utc_B": 1599744277, "score_A": 54, "score_B": 52, "human_ref_A": ">In Scotland I have free education and free healthcare...  Your education and healthcare is not just \"free\". Citizens/tax payers are paying for it. If you make 9252 a year in GBP you'll be taxed 19% of your income. If you make the equivalent in USD, 12000 a year, you'll be taxed 10% of your income. That is half less than Scotland. On top of this, in the US,  you will also have the chance to benefit from many different government services that will provide free college, free healthcare, cheap housing, daycare, food stamps, etc. If you cannot receive these services you may get most of what you paid in taxes back in a refund.  Basically in Scotland you are forced to pay nearly twice as much in taxes for services that you may not ever want or use. So it is not free for you, or a freedom to choose.  &#x200B;  >... in America not only is healthcare not free, but it\u2019s so privatised doctors have ulterior motives in recommending treatment ...  This is capitalism at work. Doctors are recommending things that are clinically proven to work.   Sure they may pick one brand over another due to incentive, but it is still essentially the same. Also many people may get prescribed a brand but instead pick up a generic version that their insurance covers or is much cheaper.  And let's not forget that if you happen to live somewhere with universal healthcare and in a densely populated area, there will be long lines for a doctor visit. When doctors make less money, there will be less doctors. And when everyone can go in for any problem, for free, there will be more patients.  &#x200B;  >....your prisons are privatised which means they don\u2019t have a vested interest in reforming you...  Only 8% of prisoners are in privatized prisons. For those 8%, I will agree with you.  &#x200B;  >.... I believe that the presumption that people could have guns makes your police more jittery leading to unnecessary shootings...  Maybe so. But not having guns would mean we depend solely on the police to protect us. On average, 67,000 lives are saved per year with fire arm self dense. There are around 1,000 people killed per year by police (this includes those who were aggressors). So I would say our guns are helping to secure our freedom, not take it away.

It doesn't mean that you are entitled to receive things from others.  Free healthcare really is the opposite of freedom.  It means that the state takes your money in order to pay for a healthcare system and you have no choice in the matter.  You don't control how that portion of your money is spent.  You don't have the freedom to provide for your own healthcare.  That's not a bad thing, america is the same with education.  I must pay my country taxes with fund my local schools.

{"post_id": "37956u", "domain": "changemyview_test", "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "history": "CMV: Whenever younger folks utter the phrase \"respect is earned, not given\" I can't help but understand it as a childish and short sighted attempt to undermine their elders. While I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously \"earning\" the respect of less experienced and established people completely ludicrous. It should be the other way around, if only for practical reasons (the respect of older people tend to be far more valuable). Now, I'm in no way denying that younger folks have valid and interesting contribution to make. I think a fresh perspective coupled with energy and enthusiasm can be an exceptional driving force. Nor am I denying that older folks can be complete assholes because their certainly can.   However, I could never bring myself to expect older, more experience and better established people to prove themselves to me. Neither can I see a reason to prove myself to younger people today. I expect respect the same way my father or professors did. Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers.   Simply put, I find this phrase (\"respect is earned, not given\") is most often used pompously by younger people to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason. To my eye, this attitude is the product of four big misconceptions:   1) **Older people demand respect because of their age and age by itself isn't worthy of respect.** I do agree that age by itself isn't a quality worthy of respect, but I don't think older folks demand respect in virtue of their age alone either. Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.  2) **Showing respect and deference to others cost me something.** Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.  3) **I know these people are whether or not they're deserving of my respect.** Assuming anything worthy of respect about someone is readily available is a common mistake. Relating to the second point, what's the price of respecting someone by default ? Worst case scenario, you change your mind later on. Best case scenario, you've done the right thing.   4) **You need to prove yourself.** False. Plenty of people \"proved themselves\" already and they shouldn't need to do it again. For instance, people get to positions of power and prestige for a reason. Getting a PhD isn't a walk in the park. Chances are they've been judged by better people than you already. I do understand their reluctance to jump through hoops again to \"earn respect\".   As such, I think one would be better served by the idea that \"respect can be lost\" rather than \"respect should be earned\". CMV.  ____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

Addressing these points:   1) **If respect costs you nothing, why don't you respect everyone?** Assuming I'm a more junior, inexperienced person, why doesn't the experienced person respect me equally? Why do people spend so much time and money to earn credentials which are supposed to equate to respect in their fields?  The answer to these points is that respect does cost me something. We don't have the luxury, with our limited time on this planet, to evaluate all corners of a decision. When someone whom I respect tells me something, I rank it higher in my decision making process. That creates an opportunity cost corresponding with any other decisions I might have made. If that more experienced person was wrong, I've suffered in some way. People will take advantage of being respected to further themselves. Look at politicians or religious figures that charge large sums of money for speaking privileges etc. How I use my respect influences my limited resources including how I spend my time; it certainly isn't free.  2) If you accept my first point that respect does cost me something, then we have to assume it's a somewhat fixed resource. **If experience == respect, then I'd have no choice how to spend that respect.** Take two politicians who have been in office the same amount of time. Chances are, you respect one more than the other; why?   Because one of them was likely right more or made decisions which you agreed with more. That means that not all experience is the same. There is some experience which is of higher quality than other experience. So let's say we work for the same company across teams and you've been around more than I have, you could say you've had more projects than I have, thus experience, but I've been right more. You've kept your business around, but it's limping more often than not. Is your experience as good as mine if I've been right a higher percentage? Should I defer to you? Heck, even if you were right as often as I was - I don't know your motives, the only ones I know are my own. The only experience I can truly count on is a shared personal experience, like working together over the years.  3) **If you only had to prove yourself once, you'd only ever have one assignment in school.** You'd only have one project at work before being promoted. A general would only have to fight one battle in war. You'd only have to go on a single date before being married.   The reality is that you prove yourself over and over again, everyday. Athletes that were stars yesterday are duds tomorrow. Faithful spouses cheat. Bosses that pushed the boundaries of a business fail to adapt with the times. Respect make make it easier to prove yourself each time a challenge comes along, but you never stop. When you stop, you've already lost that respect. You've already proven you're not worthy.", "human_ref_B": "One thing I haven't seen mentioned here is that skills tend to be less transferable then we assume.  A person who spends thousands of hours practicing and improving their ability to play chess doesn't actually improve their ability to remember strings of numbers.  They might be able to recite back the last 15 moves of the game they're playing, or have the entire board pictured in their head as they play blind folded, yet give them non-related memory tasks and they are no better then average.  Another thing that hasn't been mentioned is that when it comes to many skills, people tend to just stop improving after a while unless they put in deliberate effort.  The easiest example of this is typing speed.  People get better as they type more for a while, and then tend to stall at a relatively low speed unless they deliberately pursue something like typing lessons.  When you say that age should automatically equal respect, you bake in the assumption that the older you are, the more experienced you are.  What you neglect to account for though is that experience may only matter in a relatively narrow set of situations.  Let's say I own a bar.  If I ask my grandparents how I should market that bar, I'm sure they'll have opinions to give me.  If I ask a guy who has spent the last 2 years studying bar-marketing, he'll also have opinions to give me.  My grandparents have a lot more general life experience, but the marketer specializing in this field is clearly the better person to defer to.  Let's say instead of a bar, I have a tech company.  We're a software-as-a-service outfit specializing in text-message based marketing.  If I ask a group of 60 year old advertising agency executives how to market this, and then I ask a group of 20-somethings who've been doing online marketing for 3 years how to market this, I'm likely to get very different answers.  The older advertising agency executives might have 30 years each in advertising behind them.  They've done radio, TV, direct mail, etc.  The younger web solutions group may only have 3 years each, specializing in cost-per-click, web copywriting, web design and usability.  I think both groups would have important insights, but I would never ignore the younger web-focused group just because the ad agency has been around 10 times longer.  The younger group has more experience with situations very close to my problem, whereas the older group has general, broad-based experience but may or may not understand the nuances of this specific medium.  So how does this tie back into what your saying?  When it comes to ethical and personal choices, very few people deliberately practice to improve, and so I would expect people's talent there to peak at a relatively young age.  I wouldn't expect a 50 year old to automatically be a better authority on moral issues then a 25 year old.  When it comes to business or work decisions, although people gain a lot of experience in a certain set of situations, I'm not convinced the skills gained 'transfer' as much as we intuitively believe.  Given all that, there is some merit to the idea that you should only automatically defer to older people in some area if they have a legitiment claim to closely-related expertise.  Now young people who have no closely-related expertise are in a similar no-automatic respect situation, and if your going to be working together, there is a strong argument to be made that if they don't know very much, they should defer up the hierarchy.  But that's not an age based deference, that's a position based deference.  That's not so much due to some owed respect, rather that is the case for efficiency reasons.  If everyone argues with their supervisors whenever they kind of vaguely suspect they know better, then they will waste a lot of time and energy doing non-productive things.  Even if the more junior person is right, if the issue is such a marginal one as to make no real difference, then it's not an issue worth bringing up.  edit: To quickly add to this, the times I've most often witnessed blatant disregard for the respect deserved to a position was in university classes when mature students were present and monopolizing a professors time during class, and work situations where a younger person is supervising an older person.", "labels": 0, "seconds_difference": 6178.0, "score_ratio": 2.0}

But, the culture surrounding it, both inside clinical settings and on the internet, doesn't help people. It creates a culture of diagnosis, over actually helping people. It treats mental illness in a very medicalized way, when mental and physical illnesses shouldn't be viewed in the same way. They should be viewed with the same amount of respect. On the internet, specifically amongst teenagers, but not always, it becomes diagnosis olympics. I fell into this trap as a teenager, of becoming fascinated by what I could potentially have, as well as mental illnesses in general. Nothing wrong with that, looking into the mind is fascinating, but looking into it through that lens can lead to problems. It's not even people self-diagnosing that's necessarily the issue, cause sometimes people just know themselves, but rather viewing the mental illness as the explanation to all their problems. People behave as if these labels came before their actual experiences, when it's the opposite. Nothing really changes when you get diagnosed, people just feel comforted by it, because it is human nature to want to categorize things. I think a diagnosis can be helpful in understanding how to treat someone, and give them context into what's going on, but it's not the full picture by any means. In psychiatric hospitals, this is especially an issue, in which diagnosing people becomes the priority over actually helping them, so that people can be given meds, then sent away, since there's not enough space, and everyone is emotionally burnout (I know, that's a simplified view of what's going on).", "c_root_id_A": "hzvz7nh", "c_root_id_B": "hzw23no", "created_at_utc_A": 1646773329, "created_at_utc_B": 1646774556, "score_A": 10, "score_B": 19, "human_ref_A": "Speaking from professional experience, the DSM is a tool whose purpose is mainly twofold.

For conservatives they see a growing national debt and feel that all social programs are adding to that overall number. But this view isn't taking into account our ability to juggle the budget and, more importantly, that social programs can have positive economic influence. Government isn't always a negative factor in economics-there are gains to be had from social legislation where the free market might not have ventured. An individual company won't benefit from education reform in the short term but a more educated population, especially an areas of high poverty and crime, can be a huge asset to local business in the future.

Republicans claim to be fiscal conservatives and get elected on tax cuts for everybody, but they don't mind completely wrecking the car when they're in office because they want to destroy the government.

My understanding is that the basic idea behind anarchism is that productive property (capital) should not be owned by individuals, but should be held in common by the people who work on it through a co-op or similar arrangement.  Anarchists seem to believe that the workers will be inspired to create systems that are more efficient, more humane, and all-around superior to those of capitalist businesses.  My question is, if you want to work at a collectively owned business, then what's stopping you from starting one?  There's no law against it.  True, capital doesn't come out of thin air, but raising money for such a venture is a far more realistic goal than overturning the entire socio-political system.    There are already employee-owned businesses, and while they have their advantages, they are not nearly as revolutionary as many anarchists seem to believe their co-ops would be.  If they were more efficient, innovative, etc, they would out-compete traditional businesses in the market.  In fact, you don't even need to be part of a commune to \"own the means of production\".  You just need to invest in the company you work at, and then you'll get your share of the profits of capital.  Most people are reluctant to do this, because they understand at some level that capitalists do not make money by doing nothing, they make money by taking risks.  Many people do not want to share in the risks of their workplace, with good reason.  In the current system, we have the choice between two systems.

The second economist says \"The efficient markets hypothesis is indeed true.  And someone has picked it up.\"  You can't say that just because something hasn't been found yet, it isn't there.  In the current system we have may choices, each among many options.  Somewhere among all those possibilities, there may be one that would be better (if institutions were supportive of it) than capitalism.  Pure anarchism wouldn't force anyone into anything.  That's what the word means.  Anarcho-syndicalism or anarcho-communism comes in various flavors.  If there's a version that says all you have to do is start a co-op and everything will be utopian glory, so therefore we should force everyone into co-ops (and I wouldn't be surprised if there is), then yes, it's nonsense that's trivially refuted.    But utopian theories tend to be less readily falsifiable.  From what I've heard of them, anarchists don't seem to be clear on what would replace coercive authority.  But something would.  Maybe it's pure woo, but they have some sort of verbiage there.  Maybe the difference is that we wouldn't have to tax ourselves to support the coercive apparatus of the state: then you would have to compare tax-exempt adequately-capitalized co-ops (where the workers are all exempt from income tax too, not just the firm itself) with tax-paying privately-owned businesses, in order to refute it.  Maybe they believe that businesses are very dependent on reputation, and that being a co-op brings an air of leftist radicalism.  Maybe they believe there's something ineffable about co-ops that benefits other co-ops, so that one co-op by itself is about as viable as one telephone in a world with no others to call.  All that being said, owning shares in the company you work for is usually a lousy idea, as employees of Enron discovered when they lost their jobs and their savings at the same time.    None of the reasons why anarcho-communism will be different after the Revolution are really all that convincing.  But if you want to refute them, you have to refute them, not just note that anarcho-communism doesn't work before the Revolution.

I have a few shares of stock that my father left me, and I've never done anything with it but I still get my dividends.  Yes, the value of the stock is at risk.

Americans are too comfortable to get up and care. Everywhere else in the world, this kind of behavior by the government would have mass riots in the streets, huge anti-government demonstrations, petrol bombs, tear gas, riot police, gunfire, and serious attempts to destabilize the ruling regime. These protests and riots go on for *weeks*.  What are we going to do about it? We've been driven into left/right factions so thoroughly that we've crippled ourselves. No matter the issue, we've been trained from an early age to think a certain way and almost dehumanize the other.

If the right-leaning people start rioting, they will be dismissed as crazy gun-nut rednecks.

The bottom line is that protesting doesn't work anymore. It hasn't worked since the 50s.

You'll never organise a large number of people to do anything any more, if their actions' effectiveness depends on the acts of others - people need to feel the direct benefit of their own action or they won't bother.  Furthermore, I believe that any system which concentrates power into the hands of any 'executors' of the will of the people is bound to become an organ by which one person seeks to expropriate another - whether it's large special interests, those executors, or even you, as a voter, who seeks to control the lives of others through the ballot.

So here's some background. I'm 21 years old. I'm now working in my sixth summer job. I spent 3 summers working at a summer camp as a counsellor and activity specialist. While i did enjoy these jobs,they were also very exhausting as I pretty much had to keep a rambunctious group of children entertained all day, as well as making sure that they didn't kill themselves or each other. I made under mimimum wage during these summers, making as little as $500 for an entire summer's work during my first summer working at a camp.  I then spent another 2 summers doing physical labour, mowing lawns and gardening for one summer, and working in a patio furniture store's warehouse for another. These jobs were also very exhausting due to heavy lifting, assembling confusing patio furniture, working outside during one of my hometown's hottest summers on record, and dealing with shitty customers. I made minimum wage one summer ($10.25/hour) and slightly above minimum wage ($11/hour) for the other.  This summer, I'm working in an office for the first time. While the work can be boring and tedious at times it is mostly interesting, and perfectly suffices in passing the time. I've also been praised by my boss for the speed and efficiency in which I complete the tasks assigned to me. This is despite the fact that I spend about 35-40% of the day browsing reddit on my phone. On top of that, I'm now making more than twice the amount of money I made working physical labour. To sum it all up, I'm making double the money, to comfortably do about half the work (which is much easier anyway) I was doing before.

We have the highest nominal corporate tax rate in the world. No one pays the nominal tax rate because the tax code is riddled with exemptions and credits and discounts. Some companies have played that game so well that they pay nothing in taxes, and a handful get a net positive payment. Which is dumb.  More generally, corporate taxes are sold as a \"tax on the rich\" but that's not how it works. When companies are taxed they raise prices as much as they can so it isn't the company that pays the tax. No, I pay that tax. Yeah, the company sends in the check but I'm the one out the money. If the company can't raise prices because we collectively won't put up with that then it's the workers who are turned down for raises or don't get hired or might get laid off. If companies can get away with some 'belt tightening' to make their earnings numbers look better to investors then you bet your ass that belt is tightening.  It's only when neither of those things are possible, when prices are as high as they are going to go and the belt is as tight as it's going to get, when the person paying the tax is the shareholders of the company. But are all shareholders rich? Well, once upon a time they were, but now some of the biggest shareholders around are the funds that pay out retirement and pensions. So, you hit retirees and current workers as much as you hit rich folks.  So, what tax does generally hit rich folks? Capital gains. Why? Because it's on the other side of the equation. It's taxing rich people directly where they can't shift its responsibility to anyone else. So, why is the Capital Gains rates lower? Well, there are two reasons. First is to encourage investment, a gentle nudge towards putting money to use instead of gold-filled swimming pools. And that does work... sorta... during specific parts of the business cycle. The other reason is a fairness argument. So, you make a dollar by owning a business, shrewd planning and a not insignificant amount of design work pays off. Only that $1 you made gets taxed 35% when it leaves the company and gets hit *again* when it enters your hand? Possibly as much as another 35% if we're using income tax brackets. Well, fuck that. The Federal government gets a full 70 cents on the dollar? And then States sometimes get another 15% and occasionally a city asks for 10%. So now, fuck. I got a whole shiny nickel out of that dollar I made. While unfairness should happen to rich folk every so often there's a point beyond which it's just dumb.  We would be better off if we taxed capital gains as income dropped the corporate tax altogether to take the boot off of the dollar store shopper a bit and stop the whole \"double tax bonus\" crazy train.

Just yesterday, during the FBI and NSA hearings, he called the hearings \u201cFake News\u201d even though they were literally happening while he was tweeting about it.  He is attempting to claim a monopoly on the truth. 3.\tPower through military.  His budget proposal cuts social welfare programs, environmental protection programs, and education programs to bolster our already large military.   4.\tAttempting to discredit other branches of government.  We all remember that \u201cSEE YOU IN COURT!\u201d tweet he put out as he lost a court battle regarding the banning of people from certain nations, but the courts aren\u2019t the only one.  He has bashed Congress several times over the past few years, and especially during the election.  Claiming the courts are \u201cliberal\u201d (ie. Against what he wants) if they find him wrong, and supporting those that agree with him. 5.\tHis history of alleged sexual abuse.  Mussolini labeled women as \u201creproducers of the nation\u201d and recommended against employing them.  It\u2019s almost as though Trump shares this view and sees them as objects rather than human beings.  Whether it\u2019s walking into the changing rooms at pageants or \u201cgrabbing them by the *****\u201d, or the several allegations of sexual misconduct against him, we have to admit his history with women is a bit rocky at best. 6.\tRacial/National division.  Trump has repeatedly kicked minorities out of his rallies, including some who claim to have been legitimately there to learn his stances.  His quotes on people from Mexico and Muslims go without saying as well.  \u201cA ban on all Muslims from entering the country\u201d is one of his campaign promises.  Most people will say \u201cMuslim\u2019s aren\u2019t a race\u201d, but let me clarify: a race is just a shared characteristic between groups of people.  It doesn\u2019t have to be physical color.  It can be nationality, religion, skin color, disability, etc. I am posting this here legitimately out of trying to understand where he stands.  I\u2019m not trying to attack his character, nor his position in government.  I\u2019m just a naturally curious person and would like to see what you all think about this as well.

It's worth watching the full 16 minute video, but the answer is that the grid would need about 25% more capacity if every single person in the US switched to electric vehicles. And the grid operators can easily increase the capacity by 25%. The electric grid from 1960-2000 increased capacity by 4% per year, so it would only take about 7 years to fully increase the grid.  As for why it can get overwhelmed by AC during heat waves, that is a business choice not a physics choice. The grid could be designed to handle any demand from all the AC. But that only happens a few days a year and not even guaranteed every year. That peak capacity is wasted most of the time. This is especially true because thst demand is only for a few hours a day even on the worst days. A peak demand like that is the hardest and most expensive way to produce electricity.

Blackjack has a memory unlike other games.  Big cards good, small cards bad.  5 year-olds shouldn't gamble anyways.   Source: former casino employee and card counter.  I'll start with some terms here:  House edge: expressed in a percentage.  The money the house expect to win on each bet.    Basic stragety: a tested theorem that that dictates a players move in a given blackjack hand. Please Google basic strategy,  there's a neat color coded chart you can look at.  Units: the number of increments of the minimum bet that the table maximum will allow.  For example, if you are on a $5 minimum BJ table with a limit of $250  that only allows you to play one hand you can bet 50 units.  House edge is a representation of the mathematical advantage that the house has built in its rules..  Here are some examples.   Roulette:  straight up bet pays 35 to 1.  I'd you win you get 35 plus your bet. There is 1 way to win, and on a double 0 wheel, 37 ways to lose. If you cover every number (stupid) you lose 38 and win 36.  So your return is 36/38.  That's 94.7% return  giving the house an edge of 5.3% Craps:  betting on a hop (one roll bet) pays to 30 for 1, 30 to 1, 15 for 1, or 15 to 1.  Deference here is academic in this case, most casinos only for one, but to one is better.  The 30s are for pairs (hard ways).  Let's say you think 11 will come next roll.  There are 2 ways to roll 11, 6-5, and 5-6, if you have problems seeing this, pretend the dice are different colors.  2 dice x 6 sides = 36 combos.   You have 2 ways to win out of 36.  Or, 1 in 18.  This bet at best pays 15 to 1.  So win 16, lose 18.  That's an 88.8% return giving the house an edge of 11.2%. SERIOUSLY, I KNOW HOP BETS SUCK.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOUSE EDGE.  Bet the pass line with 10x odds.  Happy?   The edge represents the difference between the true odds vs payable odds.  With me so far?    Here's where things change. In all other games of \"chance\", these odds never change.  Two dice always roll 11 with the same 2/36 chance, number 21 comes up approximately 1 out of 38 times in roulette. This is inescapable.  Short term variance is expected and even necessary,  no one would play a game where they always lost.  But blackjack and it's variants (of the non continuous shuffle variety) are different fundamentally, they have memory.  There a finite number of cards in that games universe if you will.  In a 6 deck shoe (suits don't matter in BJ) there are 312 cards. 24 of each A-9, and 96 10 value cards (10, J, Q, K no difference between these functionally) Basic strategy is a statistical model that, based on the  rules of the casino at which you are playing, help you make the least bad decision.  I say least bad, because it is accurate.  There are no good decisions in blackjack because statistically it is still a negative expectation game.  Meaning, over a large sampling, with perfect basic strategy, you will still lose.  Now, this is for everyone in the back, STATISTICAL OUTCOMES HAVE NOTING TO FUCKING DO WITH SHORT TERM SUCCESS OR FAILURE!!!!!!  So, a recap here.  Most games suck because the odds are bad and built in.  You can chose less bad bets, but all bets are bad, get it?  But wait,  you said Black Jack is different!  It is.  As I said,  basic strategy lets you make the least bad decisions.  Some situations actually have a positive expected outcome, like doubling down when you have 11 vs a dealers up card of 6.  Keep in mind though, that the aggregate of all those situations still places you in the territory of negative expectation.    Card counting:  there are plenty of tutorials online to teach this, but as a very simple rule of thumb, because of the rules of hitting and staying that casinos follow for their dealers, big cards favor the player, while little cards favor the dealer.  I'm not going to get into the math here, it's rather lengthy, but suffice to say that knowing the ratio of big cards to little cards remaining in the deck can offer an advantage to the player.    So, why does the dealer have the advantage on black jack?  It's not their hit/stand rules.  Those only exist because if they were any more lenient to the dealer no one would play.  THE ONLY ADVANTAGE THE HOUSE HAS IN BJ IS THE DOUBLE BUST LOSS. Scenario 1.  Player has 20, dealer busts.  Player wins Scenario 2.  Player has 20, dealer has 20.  Player pushes (ties) nobody loses/wins Scenario 3.  Player busts his hand, dealer has 20.  Dealer wins.  These all seem fair so far.  Here's the one that earns all the house it's money. Scenario 4.  Player busts his hand.  Dealer busts his hand.  Player still loses.  That's it.  They only advantage.  So, try not to take hits that can bust you unless you statistically need to.  Let's now regroup.   1.  You know that busting loses your money, though paradoxically, standing when you should hit, while reducing your bust %, actually lowers your statical overall win % more. 2.  You know that because 10s are good for you and little cards are bad, if you can keep track of the ratio of that and are in the right situation, you can have an advantage over the house.  The average difference in expressed advantage generally is only 2%.  Let's say the house has a 51-49 advantage over you, sometimes you can make that 51-49 in your favor with counting.  How do you take advantage of this?  Unit betting.   Let's take a $5 dollar table. It has 7 spots.  You are the only player.  It's max is$ 500. This casino let's you play all 7 spots if the table is empty.  Therefore, the unit spread is as follows 500/5 = 100 units per spot *7 spots = 700 unit spread.  (This is an example only, doing this will get you labeled as a counter on the spot and backed off immediately) As you know the deck (shoe) favors the dealer most of the time it makes sense to expose the least amount of your money to that negative expectation.  When the 10 ratio changes in your favor, you can now expose 700 times that bet to a positive outcome.   So while you're only going to have a %2 advantage, you're now betting 3500 with a better than even chance of winning.  (YES I KNOW THINGS GET STREAKY SOMETIMES.  SHUT UP, THESE ARE BASICS. GO FIND SOME COUNTING SUB REDDIT)  So, get it?  Expose less of you money when you're at a disadvantage and more when it's in your favor.  Counting is the exact reverse of the casino model.  You're eking out wins on a small marking, but unlike the casini, you can alter your betting and actions with this knowledge   TL;DR. yes, blackjack is the a beatable game, but only if you're a card counter.   P.s. baccarat.  Yes, it is a coin flip.  And yes, I've heard of a way to count it.  Here the only situation I know of where it can be counted.  At the beginning of the shoe, the dealer reveals the first card and burns that many cards.  If you can keep track of the 10s in the shoe, and this count of remaining 10 in the deck is equal to burn cards plus the remaining cards in the deck after the cut card is pulled out, theoretically you could guarantee a tie bet, but I'd be willing that this is sore rare in practice, you're better off just studying something useful and getting a career change or a promotion.

YMMV", "human_ref_B": "Blackjack is the only game who's outcome is dependent upon past actions. Like, once an ace is played and discarded players know that ace is gone and won't be seen again.  Keeping track of what cards have been played can give a player good prediction of what will come up. Knowing that they can adjust their bets so they win big when odds are good and loose little when odds are bad.  Casinos fight against this by using multiple decks of cards, re-shuffling at random times, and good old intimidation.  \"Card counting\" (the simple process of keeping track of what's been played and understanding current odds) mathematically gives a player a 0.5% advantage over the house. Some say it's as high as 1%, some say 0.1%. But, no matter what, it won't make you rich over night. To see a 0.5% advantage pay off you'll have to play a lot and over a significant amount of time. Those who did get rich with card counting did it with a team.  And, don't forget, casinos can ask anyone to leave for no reason at all. If you're statistically winning more than you should, you may get a tap on your shoulder.  So, mathematically, yes, you'll have an advantage in blackjack because it is a continuing, past dependent, outcome.

In a sense, a built-in instinct to be extremely gullible is an evolutionary advantage for a child.  Being gullible means you learn faster because you don't try to filter any of what you're being taught through skeptical analysis.   But it comes with the downside that you learn *everything* you're being told, both true and false.  How big a downside that is varies depending on the ratio of true information to false information that you are being taught.  For a naive child who knows very little about the world, being taught by the child's parents and grandparents, there's so much new good knowledge to soak in that it's worth it to speed the process up even if that means it comes with the occasional bad knowledge.  The kid is drinking from a firehose of information and has to take in as much as possible as fast as possible.  But as the kid grows up and becomes an adult, a distrust of new information grows.  This is because as they catch up to the knowledge of the tribal elders and become just as schooled as everyone else, the ratio of good new information to bad new information changes.   Now if the information is truly new, and *especially* if it requires having to un-learn previous information because the new information contradicts the old, the probability that this is because the new information is wrong is much higher than it was when you were a child.  Now the same gullibility that served you well as a child is a detriment as an adult.  So it's not surprising that adults are more \"set in their ways\".  It's how our instincts have taught us to be.  Because it was actually a good idea once upon a time.  But in modern times, the rate of new information being learned each decade is much higher than it was for our ancestors.  When technology and society moved slowly, information you learned as a child was still good information 50 years later.  With the rate of change these days this is less true than it once was.  But instincts drilled into our DNA don't change as fast as our society does.  We may work in office buildings typing onto computers, but our brains are still optimized for the life of a hunter-gatherer wandering the grasslands.  Finding the right point between the disadvantage of gullibility (believing everything new) and the disadvantage of rigidity (believing nothing new), is a delicate balance.

There are at least three variants of water-consuming datacenter cooling.  1. The datacenter captures the hot air coming out of servers. Radiators with cool water circulating through them are used to cool this hot air. The water is heated while the air is cooled. That water is then pumped outside and poured over big fiber boards while a fan blows outside air past them. This evaporates some of the water, and the remainder is cooled by the evaporation. The remaining cooled water is pumped back inside the datacenter and the process repeats. 2. The datacenter uses industrial air conditioning units called CRACs, which have radiators outside the datacenter. The air conditioner compresses a gas, heating it up, and then pumps it through the radiator while a fan blows outside air across the radiators. Once the compressed gas is cooled, it is brought back into the datacenter and allowed to expand, which makes it cold. Air inside the datacenter is blown over a different radiator filled with this cold gas, cooling the datacenter air. On very hot days, the CRAC sprays the outside radiators with water, which evaporates on the radiator and cools it more than the air alone would. 3. The datacenter brings in outside air directly to keep the inside air cool. On hot days, the datacenter's systems will spray a mist of water into the air on its way in. That mist evaporates quickly and cools the outside air further before it reaches the datacenter floor.", "human_ref_B": "Evaporative cooling is the most cost-efficient way to cool a facility. It takes a lot of energy for water to go from (hot) liquid to gas, which means that a small amount of water being evaporated gets you a lot of cooling capacity.  However, the reverse is also true; when water goes from gas to liquid, it dumps that heat into everything around it. So if you're using evaporative cooling, then you necessarily have to eject the gaseous water as well, otherwise you're just cycling the heat from one part of the facility to another. But since you're ejecting water from the system, you need to bring in more water to replace it. Hence, you're a net \"consumer\" of water, as that water can't be used anymore.  The alternative is to use a nearby river or waterway as a heat sink. You bring cool water in from the river, run it through the cooling system to bring it from cool to warm or hot, and then dump that water back into the river, further downstream. Again, you're \"consuming\" water, except now you're also heating up the local waterway, which could have unforeseen consequences on the local wildlife.", "labels": 1, "seconds_difference": 30210.0, "score_ratio": 1.4155844156}

The total amount of energy input to the grid must equal the energy being used. Therefore, you have several classes of generation, including base load (usually big coal or nuclear plants), load followers (large or small plants that are ramped up or down to match the demand), and peakers (usually smaller stations that can be put on line in a hurry to match peak demand.) Hydropower is especially useful in maintaining balance as it can be ramped up and down dramatically in a short time.

Worst-case scenario is generation starts tripping off-line and parts of the grid become \"islanded.\" Sections can be shed off to preserve the health of the grid as a whole.

You are correct that it doesn't make any sense because at face value, this breaks the second law of thermodynamics.

The competing hypothesis involves some weird interactions with magnetic fields breaking and reconnecting. This process generates electrical currents and waves supplying heat to the corona.

This is a biological process that helps our bodies regulate various functions, including sleep and wakefulness, over a 24-hour period. This process is driven by the release of certain hormones, such as melatonin, in response to changes in light exposure.   In addition to the circadian rhythm, our brains also have other mechanisms for keeping track of time. For example, our brains can use sensory information, such as the position of the sun in the sky or the sound of a clock ticking, to estimate the passage of time. Our brains are also able to use past experiences to predict how long certain events should take, which can help us keep track of time in the absence of external cues.   It's possible that your ability to wake up at a specific time without an alarm is due to your brain's ability to keep track of time using these mechanisms. It's also possible that your brain has learned to anticipate when you usually wake up and has adjusted your sleep patterns accordingly.   Overall, our ability to keep track of time is a combination of biological processes and learned behaviors, and it's an important part of how we function in the world.", "labels": 1, "seconds_difference": 2463.0, "score_ratio": 1.4}

There are 92 kinds of atoms which are natural and half a dozen which are man made. Atoms are made of protons, neutrons and electrons. The number of protons an atom has determines what element it is. For example, Hydrogen is hydrogen because every one of its atoms each has a single proton.   Elements can be turned into other elements but not using chemistry. Alchemists tried to turn lead to gold, but failed. This is because it takes more energy than can be gotten from chemical reactions. To truly turn one element into another, nucleur energy is required. This is a physical change, not a chemical one.   Elements being created and destroyed is a very common phenomenon. The most obvious example is the sun. The sun's gravity is so enormous that at its center atoms of Hydrogen are so comprerssed that their protons combine. This destroys the Hydrogen atoms and a new atom is created, Helium. Helium is an atom which has two protons. The sun can also make even bigger atoms. Carbon has 6 protons and Iron has 26. However, Carbon and Iron are much harder to compress and it takes much more energy to create them. In fact Iron is so hard to make the sun can't make atoms any larger than Iron. Bigger atoms get made when really massive stars explode in an event known as a supernova. The star blows itself apart and this provides the energy needed to makd Iron into bigger atoms like Iodine, Lead and even Gold. All the Gold on earth was formed when a hudge star exploded many billions of years ago. The dust cloud eventually re-condenced into the earth and sun. When stars makd bigger atoms out of smaller atoms it is called nucleur fusion.   There is another way to make new atoms and it happens right here on earth. Uranium has 92 protons and this makes it very unstable. Uranium atoms can fly apart into two pieces if hit by subatomic particles. This is how a nucleur generator and atomic bombs work. This kind of reaction is known as nucleur fission. Unlike nucleur fusion, the exact kind of new atoms are impossible to calculate. When big atoms split, it is like breaking a rack of pool balls. There is only probabilities that certain new atoms will form. Most of the time the two new atoms get roughly half the number of protons each, but it is not exact. These new atoms are called nucleur waste or nucleur fallout. Strontium, Iodine, Xenon and Barium are the kinds of atoms which form when Uranium splits apart.   Reguarding the ore, a powerful acid known as aqua regia will dissolve the gold, platinum and palladium, leaving the Rhodium behind. The dissolved metals are then separated using other chemicals.

There are a lot of dubious claims that diet soda is bad for your health, but they all seem to fall apart under scrutiny.", "labels": 1, "seconds_difference": 14207.0, "score_ratio": 4.6356877323}

The car was NOT towed away. The city that it was towed in stated that the car was reported repossessed. Guy claims he has the pink slip and owns the car. (We have the pink slip). Number and business given to us by Police Department lead to a dead line, and the lot has been closed for 2 months. The car was effectively stolen and nobody can help us because the city of \\~\\~blank\\~\\~ reported it as repo'd, which means we can't even report stolen to our insurance.      List of facts:   \\-Mom is not on great terms with ex.   \\-We last saw the car on Sunday, the 14th.   \\-The Police department was shown \"proof\" (their words) that this vehicle was repo'd via a call.  \\-Car was repo'd Tuesday afternoon, the 16th  \\-We weren't notified until the 17th.   &#x200B;  So, we call ex Wednesday morning to get the car back so that we can get some general maintenance done on it cause it's an old bmw and burns oil lol. And she tells us if it's a joke, and that we \"already had the car since yesterday\" and that \"everyone saw us take the car\". This is not true because my mother was with me the whole day on tuesday, and then I went to work. So we go on high alert, and go to ex's house to see if she's just fucking with us to try and get us to see her again. She only has the keys. She claimed that we drove off the bmw with our spare keys but...we don't have spare keys for the car. Only one pair of keys, which are the ones that she had. We take the keys and call the local police department, and they tell us that the car was repo'd under the company name of \"Image Auto\" and given a number that leads to a dead line.      So we call back and ask for the number that the guy called from. We call that number, and some guy that sounds like the redhead from megamind answers. We ask him if he knows anything about a blue bmw, he says he doesn't. We end the call and call back the police, they redirect us to the records department in the city sheriffs office. They even tell us that this is very new to them and that they've never seen this before. The sheriff then calls the number, and the comes back to us saying that the guy claims that he owns the vehicle, and has the pink slip. It was now a civil matter, and out of their hands. So we go the DMV to get any information on this.      DMV prints out the history of the vehicle and proves that there are no leans on the vehicle and that it belongs to my mother and I, and the only other person in the history is the person we bought it from as a prior owner for a handful of years before. That is it. There is nothing else on the list.      Now it becomes a legal matter again. But the police department refuses to help us because we don't have the original pink slip. Of course we don't have the original pink slip. The DMV kept it when they sent us the new one when we did the title transfer. I don't know what we can do. We already reported the whole situation to the DMV as fraud but...like, all we have in terms of the guy is the name Tony, and his company lot. That's it. We know nothing else. We were told that the dmv would send out an investigator some time next week. We just want to see proof that this guy has some kinda lean on our car.

My down payment, my credit, my mortgage. He didn\u2019t pay anything. His name was never on anything. Not the title, not the insurance, not the mortgage, not even the utilities.   We did have an unwritten agreement that he\u2019d pay half the mortgage, utilities, and other shared expenses like groceries. And for about a year, maybe, he did pay me varying amounts of money. It was never half, and it caused a lot of arguments. Whatever he paid me, he paid in cash. Since summer 2011 I have paid all of it. He pays for whatever food he eats outside of groceries and covers whatever expenses he has. I don\u2019t know anything about that.

I moved out of state. He stayed in my house.

He challenged the eviction and the court date is the first week of November.   Through all of this the ex refused to communicate. I never had any idea what he was thinking.

Five years ago my friend received a phone call from a (newly) ex-girlfriend alerting to him that she was pregnant. Being a stand up guy the two got back together and tried to make the relationship work. They stayed together until the baby was born and later split up (within the first year). New Jersey handled the custody and child support hearings. About two years ago the mother moved to Pennsylvania without alerting the court.  Neither mother, nor my friend, live in New Jersey now and the case was never moved. My friend now lives in CA with his new wife and new born son.   Upon seeing his new born he had a gut feeling his 5 year old may not actually be his. On the advice of a lawyer he conducted the paternity test (called a \"peace of mind\" test) and learned he is not the father.   He is devastated but will be pursuing the removal of his name from the birth certificate and the termination of his child support payments.   He is wondering what he can expect through the courts. We've heard terrible stories of men who have been lied to about paternity being held responsible for continued child support payments because the courts like to keep a support system for the child.   The mother is a bit rough. Fresh neck tattoo, knuckle tatts, a single mother, but does have the support of a well-off family. My friend and his wife are living with her (his new wife's) family just trying to make ends meet with their own new child.   They will be hiring a lawyer but want to know what the first steps should be. Does he keep this a secret from the mother(is there a reason) or must he immediately state his findings? Are they in for a big fight (how expensive/experienced of a lawyer should he be looking to hire). Will the judge for sure order a court appointed paternity test based on his independent finding or could even that be denied? Any chance for repayment of the five years or child support payments?

Sometimes this comes as power lines, in your case it might end up being a box culvert with some pipes buried, who knows.   As far as I know, this isn't the same as public property. The project I'm dealing with now has an open utility area that we're working in that is owned by a housing association, for example. I would imagine the spot you're in is somewhat similar to that in so far as it's still your land, but the city could come in in a few years and say \"hey, we need to lay a pipe through your backyard\".   Now the interesting thing to me, is that these plats are usually somewhat historical documents. The ones I'm working off of were made close to 80 years ago, for example.  I find it somewhat weird that they're trying to convert to an open access land use. I would consult with an attorney that specializes in land dispute cases and see what they say about this. This could very well be a case of the city simply not knowing that this land is being utilized.   In the meantime, I would suggest against building on this plot. If it's converted to an open utility area and they need to lay a pipe down where your brand new deck is, you're SOL (also dealing with this right now for my project).  Edit: one last thing to add, the city might be dodgy about telling you what this means because the person you're talking to might legitimately not know.

This person planted drugs in the car and garage and called the police and CPS about it and she was charged and child was taken into foster care, did something to the deed of her condo and it was stolen from her and sold, lied about things she did at work to her fired, hacked into her computer and planted disgusting porn involving children and alerted the police about that, impersonated her at the bank and stole all her money and hit my cousin with a motorcycle leaving her badly injured. After all of this my cousin committed suicide. Months after this the actions started to come unraveled when footage from a camera showed the bike speeding away (with a plate registered to the person) and the person was caught receiving a tax return in my cousins name.  Everything came out eventually. This person was arrested and jailed for everything she did to my cousin and for other crimes related to marijuana and obstructing justice. I have done my best to move on. This was over a decade ago. The person's parents have begun to do to me what I believe is harassment. Same to other members of my family, including my 90 year old grandmother who is in a retirement home. The person who hurt my cousin has cancer. Her parents want us to forgive her before she dies. They have come to my house in person 9 times, sent me 15 letters, had 2 different lawyers send me letters asking me to meet with this person in jail while she is still \"well\".

They have also went to see my teenage niece at the bus stop outside of her school (she was just a baby when this happened) and visited my brother over a dozen time at his job and sent him a bunch of letters.

And this is *after* they finished the procedure. I was told that they'd have to go back in and start over and undo everything they'd done to this point.   I was in so much discomfort and pain plus I had to leave to pick up.my daughter from school soon...had no time to do it then and was told that I probably would never know it was there and if it bothered me to come back and they'd deal w it then.    Well,  about 3 weeks later the pain began. And got worse and worse. I called, made the appointment,  and after a prolonged exam and  way too much hedging and hand wringing the dentist admitted that it was the bit that had infected the surrounding tissue.   Now FF to the extraction date and it was at the end of the day, after hours and from jump I could tell he was NOT happy about having to do this. No hello . No \"how are you feeling \".  No pre shot numbing of injection site as he always had done before. Just GO. The shots were brutal and his technique was rough and rushed.  But we got started.     About an hour and a half in and they can't get to it. They take several sets of x-rays throughout  the proceedure but towards the end they take me to the back to do another xray. Only this one took a full 360 pan of my whole mouth so they could get a good look. When I get back to the chair he starts working again and I feel pain from the work site and I tell him (this is the 3rd time he has had to re apply novacane for the same reason ) he reaches abruptly for the needle sitting on the tray and plunges it in my open tooth and sends a searing white hot dose of lava right into the nerve.   The world went white. My ears rang. My eyes streamed w tears.  I couldn't see. I couldn't hear.  All I could do was gasp for air and then I screamed as I arched my back off of the chair. And all I could hear is him muttering under his breath: \"You don't have to hurt people... you shouldn't have to hurt people. \" He never apologized. He never asked if I was ok. He just sat there... muttering to himself until the dental assistant checked on me and wiped away 2 streams of grown man tears from my face.   After this he decided he'd had his fill of working around my tooth to get to the bit  and filed my molar down to NOTHING to get to it.  Like... the tooth is gone.  All but a shallow sliver that he intend to put a crown on. But I didn't want or need the crown.  I couldn't afford to do it after the 1st root canal and still cannot.  However he justified this by saying that tooth was going to need a crown anyway so he just \"shaved it down\".    When my wife picked me up and I got in the car, all I could do was cry.  I sobbed for the pain and the agony, of what had happened but also for the humiliation and violation of losing a piece of my body that I had paid hundreds of dollars just weeks ago to keep whole.  I was never asked if it was OK to take my tooth. He just did.   Today I experience nerve pain every time I eat.  I always feel like I had a brutal root canal 2 days ago after every meal.. Even if I'm careful.  Plus if I apply *any* pressure to the side of my face where he injected me it's as if it is happening all over again... the nerve is still white hot, and fear it always will be.   I have not gone back and am afraid to see anyone much less him.   Do I have a case for malpractice? What can I do about this?

Also had me sign a \"receipt for access to vehicle fees\" that turned out to be a damage waiver. Hello, I am fairly sure a towing company that towed my car is violating quite a few civil laws and possibly some criminal ones as well.   &#x200B;  Backstory: Went out of town for \\~2 weeks and parked my truck in the parking lot of the apartment complex where I live (Gated parking with clicker to get in). When I come back in town, truck is missing so I call the number on the \"No Public Parking\" sign and leave a voicemail, which I still haven't heard anything back from. I find some numbers online, and eventually get in contact with a gov't worker who told me that Generic Towing Company Name had my vehicle.   I found their phone number online, and figured that I would have to pay a few hundred and call it a sad day. However, when I called they informed me they wanted over 1500 dollars for the towing/storage fees since they had towed it apparently only a few days after I had gone out of town. I contacted the building manager of my apartment and they had no idea about any towing (relevant later) .  I then go down to the tow company (located in a whole different city from where I live) and try to prepare myself the best I can with what I want to know/find out. I read up on  http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes\\_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=22651.07.&article=1.  and some other readings and then went into the place.   The entire operation reeked of being sketchy. Hand drawn sign with rates and about 3 inches of poly-carb windows on the teller. I asked for a list of the things I owed them this $1500+ for and they refused to give me any bill/statement of what I owed saying \"Unless you are paying right now, I'm not writing anything down\". I then asked to get my personal items out of my car. They then said there was a $115 \"access fee\" in order for me to walk \\~15 feet to the truck and get my items from within. I also was refused the right to inspect the truck. He also refused to give me any paperwork outlining when/where/why it was towed  (he eventually gave me limited amounts of this info after I paid for access to the truck, but initially refused and said it wasn't needed)  All three of these seem to be in violation of the document linked. I said there was laws saying I needed to be able to get my personal items out of the car without fee. They said they didn't care and there was a charge. I needed items from my car so I said I was willing to pay the fee. They then said they needed \"proof of ownership and photo ID\". I said what counts as proof of ownership and they said \"Car title, proof of insurance, or registration\" I informed them all of those were in the car (pretty standard?) glove compartment. They then said they would need a key to the truck as \"proof of ownership\". I said the truck was unlocked so they could retrieve documents without it, but they insisted it was needed to \"verify ownership\". I relented and turned over a key. They retrieved the documents and then allowed me to pay the fee. I asked for a receipt and the guy glared at me then said he needed to write it up. I start loading stuff from the truck into my friends car and then he comes out with my \"receipt\" to sign. I know, I know, I should have been vigilant and not signed it blindly but I did. Turns out what I actually signed was a release of liability for any damages to the truck.   Finally, I ask for the key back. He refuses, saying \"I want verification you were here\". When I brought up I was on his security camera, he said \"thats too much work to get the tapes and all, this is easier\"  &#x200B;  Reading here ( http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes\\_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=22658. ) it also seems sketch that my landlord/building manager wasn't contacted because it seems they would have to approve the tow. According to the records I eventually got from the towing company, it was noted at 10am and towed at 9pm, which is far less than the 24-hrs outlined in the link.  &#x200B;  All of this feels and reads to be illegal and sketchy on multiple counts. Please let me know if this is an accurate view and if taking them to civil court would be advisable. Can I threaten to sue unless the fees are brought to something more reasonable or is that unlawful intimidation? I'd honestly be fine paying 500 or something just to make all of this go away.

Like for example, I opened a credit card with a $25k credit limit, maxed it out in a few months, and then tried to file for bankruptcy.  So as mentioned below, you'll need to find out if the business has definitely filed for bankruptcy.  My hunch is that they probably haven't.   If they haven't, you'll need to take them to court in order to recover your money.  I am unsure what amount your deposit was, but you may only need to take them to small claims court. Check here, it discusses claim amounts:  https://www.nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/smallclaims/ Small claims court is pretty straight forward, and you may not need a lawyer.  I've known plenty of people that have been successful without a lawyer in small claims, but I also live in California where you're NOT allowed to bring a lawyer to small claims, and must appear on your own.  I am unsure if NY will allow you to have a lawyer, but I believe so.  Regardless, it may not be worth paying for a lawyer, and worth you appearing on your own if you feel comfortable.  Furthermore, it sounds like you're not the only one, and depending on how many people they've ripped off and the dollar amount in total, you may qualify for a class action.  In this case you will need to consult with an attorney that has experience with this - one that does free consultations.  If they have filed for bankruptcy, I would do as previously suggested in comments.  Edit: I now see the think to the ReBar article.  That is horrible!  I'm so sorry.  So yeah, I would find out if they have actually filed for bankruptcy, and then contact the police.  This sounds like embezzlement, and then consider consulting with an attorney that handles class action cases.  It will be less of a head ache to go this route than doing small claims, but you can still try small claims, depending on the dollar amount if you want.  You're more likely to get all your money back, rather than a portion going to an attorney if you go to small claims.  There is definitely something shady going on here and probably criminal.  Your deposits are not income until services are performed.  You're not a creditor in anyway.  You and the other people that gave deposits were not loaning money or giving a line a credit.

About a week ago i received a summons to appear in court as a witness to an incident where i was assaulted by a customer. The law suit seems to be between my previous employer and the person who assaulted me.  In may 2020 I was working as a greeter at a retail store in TX, i told someone they were required to put a mask on, person refused, I asked them to leave, the person slapped/pushed me, and had a meltdown. I never touched the customer, and immediately retreated. A customer called police. I never went to the ER or anything. Woman was arrested, I gave my statement to the cops. Never heard anything about it from the police again.  My employer was really pissed off and a week later I was sacked for failing to follow procedures in handling this customer after review. I don't know what procedures, but I was pissed off. But I was already planning to give notice so I just made a vow to never shop there again.

Do not ignore a summons.   Some of this is unclear from your description.  The following is my approximate layman's understanding, hopefully an expert will correct anything I've messed up here.    \u2022 A legal summons is issued by the court and signed by a judge. It can be prepared by a law firm, but it's not just issued by a law firm. If this  is a legal summons, you should direct questions/concerns to the court, not  the law firm.  \u2022 A state has no direct authority to compel a witness who is not a resident of that state, however they can request that a court in your state issue you a subpoena.  If this is a summons signed by a TX judge, you should inform the Texas court that you are not a resident of Texas.  They will have to follow procedures for a subpoena in NY, and you should have an opportunity to make the case for undue hardship at that time.  This may not be successful.  If you've received a notice signed by a NY judge, then you will need to respond to the NY court.    \u2022 The law firm that sent you the notice does not work for you, and is not on your side or required to consider your interests here.  Do not take advice from them or expect them to help you.   \u2022 \"Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Without the State in Criminal Proceedings\" (Texas Code of Criminal Procedure - CRIM P Art. 24.28) requires that the demanding state at least pay for the travel expenses and accommodations for out of state witnesses, and potentially other expenses.  I believe NY requires witnesses to be paid $15/day (like jurors), so (while not much) you may be entitled to that as well.  So on this point, the law firm is (I think) misleading you.    \u2022  You are required by law to appear for a valid summons.  You need to respond to clear this up, preferably with the help of a lawyer.   You can read more about this process: https://codes.findlaw.com/tx/code-of-criminal-procedure/crim-ptx-crim-pro-art-24-28.html  https://codes.findlaw.com/tx/code-of-criminal-procedure/crim-ptx-crim-pro-art-35-27.html  https://www.tdcaa.com/journal/securing-an-out-of-state-witness/  Strongly suggest you find some legal assistance ASAP.  Absolutely do not ignore this, you need to communicate to the court that you are not a resident of TX, that this is a severe hardship, and figure out a reasonable way forward.  If you are in NYC there are lots of legal aid services available for low income residents.

She had the land surveyed a few years ago so she knows he is on her property.  Last year she put up wooden stakes with rope along the property line and jerk neighbour pulls them out of the ground and throws them onto her property.  She's in her 80's and lives alone.  Bylaw has been called after that incident and they spoke with the neighbour but things have only gotten worse.    The neighbour has been digging during the night, a septic tank hole which is deep and about 20 feet into her property.  My husband went out with a professional surveyor today to find out where exactly the property lines are and now it is clearly marked, with this big hole in Grandma's yard.  We already have someone lined up to fill in the hole but we are concerned about the liability issue since it's on her property.    We are building a fence in the coming weeks along the property line.  When he first started digging, Grandma decided it was time to build a fence to hopefully end this.  What we didn't know before the surveyor came out was why he was digging this hole - there's pipes in it and it is for a septic bed.  We assume he had no permits since he did it during the nights and not during the day so my Grandma is going to Town Hall to speak with someone there about this.

The dog owner would argue that the fog was killed because your beekeeper disturbed the hive that you allowed to exist on your property.  However your lawyer would argue that bees are wildlife and you did not settle them there and were taking steps to remove them in a responsible manner and that their dog would not have died if it had not been tied up (if this is illegal it would be mentioned here) outside.

{"post_id": "4zb890", "domain": "legaladvice_test", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "history": "[AK] After an ugly 4 yr long custody battle, I have not seen my children for 3 years. I just found out that my 12 year old son is dying from cancer, and my ex is refusing me access to medical information and visits to my child. I apologize in advance, there is no easy way to explain this story, this will be a wall of text. I will endeavor to keep it as brief and relevant as possible.   I was married for 10 years to a narcissistic, abusive, sociopath. Most of the abuse leveled at me was emotional/intimidation, but he was physically abusive to my daughter from a previous relationship, and our three sons. When I moved out, he physically attacked me, nearly breaking my arm and causing extensive soft tissue damage. This is relevant later.   In 2005, our oldest son died of leukemia. He was 2. In 2009, our middle son was diagnosed with lymphoma. He successfully completed treatment and has been in remission for nearly 7 years.   We separated in 2009, right after my sons treatment was finished, and filed for divorce shortly after. I filed a DV report when he attacked me. He hired a criminal defense attorney, absolutely assassinated my character, convinced my mother to testify against me, as well as our blind elderly neighbor who \"saw\" the entire incident. The case was dropped.   During the divorce hearing, I filed for full custody. In Alaska, in most cases, that automatically guarantees the other parent will get custody (if they are asking for 50/50 joint custody). I did not know this at the time, and my lawyer pushed for full because of the DV hearing. The judge reviewed the files/recording, decided on the spot I was a liar because the other case was dropped, and awarded joint custody.   For four years, my ex dragged me back to court for every excuse he could find, to complain about my unwillingness to cooperate and co-parent with him. He paid a counselor (a substantial cash payment, outside of our insurance coverage, with additional gifts such as fishing trips and work done to his property) to testify against me in court. I did not find out until much later that the counselor was practicing with a suspended license for ethics violations (false testimony in other family court cases) the entire time he was \"treating\" my children. Every time we went to court, I lost more and more rights/privileges.   In 2013, he filed multiple abuse investigations with OCS, culminating in a police investigation and restraining orders being filed against me after I returned my children to him with bruises (bruises were NOT from abuse, the children stated that, OCS stated that, and the doctor that examined them stated there was no way to conclude they were the result of abuse). However, I did admit in court to spanking my children, with my hand, 1 time over the week the bruising occurred.   By this time, the judge was not even bothering to hide her disgust for me every time we came to court. She stated that in the case of the spanking, it was a violation of the no corporal punishment clause in our divorce decree (true), that my children were in fear for their lives because they behaved immediately afterward, and that the spanking met the definition of assault. She granted a one year protective order against me, ordered parenting classes, a domestic violence intervention program, mandatory counseling, and reduced my visitation to 6 supervised hours per week, with a supervisor of my ex's choosing.   I completed all ordered services. My ex, however, refused to comply with the visitation. Or rather, he made visitation so logistically and physically impossible, he might as well have refused. He always made it clear that when I could not meet his conditions, it was MY refusal to comply, not him denying access.   With the help of my counselor, I made the decision to walk away. This entire situation was a narcissists dream - he maintained all control and could \"punish\" me for leaving through my children. By removing myself from the power struggle, even knowing that he was not a good person, or a good parent, the hope was he would drop his obsession for controlling me, and focus on raising our boys in a healthier atmosphere. It is the hardest decision I have ever made in my life.   I did get behind in child support for some time, as I had a hard time finding work. But it was paid whenever I was working, and not only has it been paid consistently for nearly two years but all of my arrearages have long since caught up. I have had absolutely zero contact with my ex or my children in just over three years.   I found out over the weekend that my 12 year old son, after being in remission for 7 years, has relapsed, and is in very poor condition. At 12, my son weighs 56 lbs. he has always been a small child, but he is the size of an average 6-7 year old. My ex so stubbornly refused to take him to the doctor, despite OBVIOUS signs of illness, including a tennis ball sized mass on his chest, that when the cancer spread to his spine and began putting so much pressure on his brain that he is exhibiting stroke symptoms (face drooping, balance issues, slurred speech), my ex still sent him to school, and the school had to intervene and refuse to allow him back until he had a doctors clearance. My younger son is also displaying some rather alarming signs of abuse/mistreatment.   At this point, their father still refuses to contact me to tell me about our sons health. He is blocking my attempts to access medical records or speak with the doctors. He has told others that if I try to go to the hospital he will have me arrested (he can't, but he can cause a huge scene and upset my son).   I have applied to legal aid previously, and was denied - custody cases are rarely given assistance by legal aid here. I cannot afford an attorney. I pay 52% of my income to child support. I barely eat, but I will do whatever I have to to support my kids.   I know I need to speak with an attorney. I have left messages for several that friends have referred me to in the hopes that one will consider a pro bono representation, or allow some sort of payment arrangements.

My dad owned the same house for over 40 years. He owned it before he married my mom and she inherited it when he died. A few years after he died, she decided to move to where my sister lives and put the house up for sale.  Guy suing (calling him A-hole1) is a complete psychopath who has lived in the neighborhood 20+ years and everyone hates him. There are a thousand things we could talk about with him but the important bits are he\u2019s a lawyer (not actually practicing) and a doctor (who lost privileges at the local hospital for being a psychotic asshole but not his license somehow and is still in private practice). So, he\u2019s got a shitload of money and knows the law and also has bought up pretty much every other lawyer in town.  He\u2019s also been methodically buying up every property he can in my mom\u2019s neighborhood and turning them into rentals, subdividing lots and building more rentals, and basically doing his best to take over and ruin what was some very premium real estate right next to a national park.  When my mom\u2019s house went up for sale, he immediately showed up on her doorstep (literally a couple of hours after it posted), and offered her her asking price in cash. She told him she\u2019d think about it, because it freaked her out and she didn\u2019t know quite what to do, and she said he was visibly pissed when he left.   My mom isn\u2019t stupid, but she has never bought or sold a property in her entire life, so she relied heavily on her realtor. The realtor told her she could definitely wait on A-hole1\u2019s offer and see if anyone else wanted to go higher. She then got a higher offer and took it\u2014but, rather mysteriously, that offer fell through under some weird circumstances and my mom didn\u2019t have a buyer anymore. She had closed on her new house already, so she was even more freaked out and wanted to hurry up and sell even though my sister and I told her to calm down and wait.  She then got an offer from a guy who\u2019s a lawyer and on the city council (A-hole2). It was for more than her asking price, and *he waived an inspection and a survey* and just bought the place. So my mom took it and moved.  Now, the trouble comes from a detached garage my dad had built. He owned several acres so there were lots of spots to build this thing, but he decided to put it off the end of the driveway. He had a professional contractor come build it, and while my mom had almost no input, she says a survey was done it make sure it was far enough from the neighbors\u2019 property to be okay.   The properties have no distinct borders; it\u2019s just a big meadow, no fence line or obvious markers. Also the neighbors are life-long friends of my parents so if there had been an issue it would have probably been easy to solve. Apparently the garage is a tiny bit too close to the property line, like less than a foot (and this is a thing I do not fully get, because it\u2019s a building next to an open meadow sooooo it\u2019s not encroaching on anything, and we don\u2019t have to cross the property line to access it).   But my mom had no idea about that, and presumably neither did my dad. My dad\u2019s terminal illness did affect his brain and he did definitely make some bad choices before he was declared incompetent legally, so it\u2019s possible this was one of them. But given the timing, I don\u2019t think so.  Anyway, this no-inspection, no-survey sale goes through, and a little while after that my mom got an email from A-hole1. Turns out, A-hole2 bought the place from my mom, but had been in cahoots with A-hole1 all along. *He\u2019d purchased the house just to turn around and deed it to his buddy A-hole1.*  A-hole1 then did the survey, and then found out about the garage problem. He told my elderly, widowed mom that she\u2019d lied intentionally about it, and unless she paid him $50k to tear down the garage and move it(which cost $12k to build four years prior), he\u2019d sue her. He also claimed her realtor had sworn on a stack of bibles there was nothing to worry about and that\u2019s why A-hole2 hadn\u2019t done the survey.  She got a lawyer, and got a confession from A-hole1\u2019s lawyer that they knew she hadn\u2019t been dishonest and they just hoped she\u2019d \u201cpitch in\u201d to move the garage like she\u2019d just be a good sport after the bullshit he had put her through (and his track record of being a psycho neighbor from hell).  So, original thing got dropped. But now, months later, A-hole1 is trying the same thing again.   My mom got a summons served to her new house; again she\u2019s elderly and by herself most of the time (other than her giant-ass Rottweiler she can\u2019t control and that\u2019s another topic) so she doesn\u2019t ever just open the door.   She saw a strange person on her doorstep using her doorbell camera, and talked to the person through the mic.  Person said they were serving her and she needed to open the door. Of course that freaked her out and she didn\u2019t; she told the person she didn\u2019t know who they were and she wanted to talk to her lawyer first. That person cussed her out and just left. All this was captured on the camera.  My mom\u2019s original lawyer bowed out because his partner had just (*coincidentally*\\s) been bought out by A-hole1. She had to try super hard to find a lawyer after that and ended up with someone literally across the state because he\u2019s bought every firm on this side.  So\u2026 my mom is being targeted by a fucking psychopath who did not actually buy her house, but got it through a straw purchase. He would totally would ruin her financially just because she spited him by not taking his first offer.   How worried should she be?

{"post_id": "kei95e", "domain": "legaladvice_test", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "history": "NE: My sister's husband died and now his ex-girlfriend has popped up saying he has two children and she would like money for support. Posting for my sister who doesn't know how to reddit.  My sister was was with her husband for 5 years, married for 3, no children.  Before their relationship he was in a relationship with (but never married to) another woman - my sister does not know much about their relationship.  My sister's husband had a successful career and made good money, but shortly after their marriage he was diagnosed with a serious illness. He immediately went into aggressive treatment and had to stop working due to the side affects, but the treatment was unsuccessful and he never returned to work. During that time my sister supported them both. He received some money from disability insurance during this time.  He eventually passed away 10 months ago.  Prior to his death he and my sister saved a large sum of money over the course of their relationship which they used to buy a home in cash prior to his death. So - he did not leave much of anything behind and his \"will\" has already been settled.  My sister has now been informed that his ex-girlfriend has two children who she says he fathered, and she filed for child support prior to learning he is deceased. Now she says that she plans to take legal action against his estate for a share of his assets for her children.  My sister is worried about two things:     (1) She is not confident this woman is telling the truth. This is definitely a woman they dated, but he at least was never aware of having children and my sister does not believe the children look anything like him. I know this is an emotional response BUT it begs the question of proving paternity. He was cremated, my sister has nothing remaining containing his DNA, and he does not have known living relatives whose DNA can be used for comparison. How do we know if this woman is telling the truth - or if they aren't his kids and she is just trying to pull a fast one?  (2) My sister is worried about the possibility of a lawsuit. They had just purchased a home, so they had little in cash except their emergency fund. He had nothing left in his retirement fund and had a modest life insurance policy which my sister was the recipient of. Is there a scenario in which my sister has to dig into her own pockets to fund \"child support' or whatever you would call it in this scenario?  &#x200B;  For the record, my sister did have a brief consultation with a family attorney who was recommended in our area for child support matters. He told her not to worry about it until she gets legal papers, and that it's unlikely to go anywhere at this point as her husband is literally deceased. He did help her with letting the other state's child support folks know that he is deceased and sending a copy of the death certificate. He said if she receives anything from any lawyer, or anything from a child support agency, to come back and talk to him again.   She appreciates his advice and was calmed by it, but she is still nervous about this. I'm hoping instead of wasting another lawyer's time with a second opinion that may be the exact same, you all might be able to give some insight as to whether she should be concerned / do anything.

After 2 weeks we came across a post on Facebook, a guy was claiming that his 12 year old cat came home after being missing for 2.5 years.  The woman that took the cat, lives 5 doors away from me, she claimed that the cat walked into her house, and she called her ex boyfriend to come and pick up the cat. So she confirmed that she took the cat and gave it away.   Since then we have been in contact with the ex boyfriend, we asked to view the cat as it looked a lot like our cat. At start of our conversation he sent us more pictures of the cat and we were positive it is our cat. So we asked again if we could see the cat, he refused aggressively. But in the end he agreed to meet at the police station, we asked him again to see the cat in person and he accepted, we come to his house and we see that it's 100% our cat.  We also found a photo of the cat that he claims came back to the after 2.5 years of being missing, and it's 12 years old.  We had a verbal agreement to go the vet next day and verify that the cat is not 12 years old and is 18 months old. But he blew us off and started threatening us if we keep contacting him.   That same day a man shows up to our door claiming to be a vet and saying that the ex boyfriend has emotional issues and that he is emotional unstable. The vet then started asking us  if we could leave the cat with him out of good will. We are completely shocked with how unprofessional that \"vet\" was. And he got our address without our consent from the woman that took the cat the vet also confirmed that.   We went to the police but they say their hands are tighed. The cat is not microchipped but we have all the photos to prove we also got it from a friend that fosters kittens. And the ex boyfriend and the woman does not have any other photos of their missing cat than the ones we found on their social media.   We are looking for any help with this.
